# The trans prison stats argument

^2024-10-19

An argument I've been seeing online for a while now is that trans people are statistically more likely than the general population to be **sex offenders**. Sex offender is a category that includes sexual assault, rape, pedophilia, possession of child pornography, and indecent exposure---so, anything that's a crime that has something to do with sexual actions. A criminal pervert.

The idea that trans people are perverts is an old stereotype, but what if it turned out to be true? There are some unfortunately-true statistics about small groups of people, like how black people are more likely to commit murder, or gay men are more likely to have sexual diseases, or how trans people are more likely to experience suicidality. Could we also be more likely to sexually assault people?

I thought about whether that maps onto my experience. It didn't *sound* right to me. I understand the suicidality, but trans women don't seem like likely to go out and sexually assault anybody. But perhaps trans women are such a small subset of people in the first place that it doesn't take much for a smaller subset of abusers to become statistically significant. After all, trans people are a troubled demographic, more likely to be socially maladjusted, have problems with their family, to feel rejected by society---and it does seem that trans women are more likely to have progressive attitudes about sex and sexuality. So *maybe* there's something to this? It's not beyond imagination. I looked into.

How was any of this 'verified'? By prison statistics. The idea we're more likely to be sex offenders can be traced back to the same few sources claiming a higher percentage of trans people in prison were sex offenders than the general prisoner population. Does nobody hear the problem with that? Maybe they don't. Statistics are tricky for most people, and sometimes the correct inference isn't the intuitive one. Even if this claim were true as presented, it wouldn't entail the conclusion that's offered.

For injecting this rhetoric into our discourse, we can thank the UK-based group called *Fair Play For Women*, a leader in trying to sound the alarm on the serious issue of trans perverts sneaking into women's prisons.

## Let's uncritically accept the data & see where it takes us

The UK prison service is split into three systems:

* England and Wales
* Scotland
* Northern Ireland

We're only going to be examining the first, because it's by far the largest, and the other two were less willing to share their numbers. In 2017, the combined population of England and Wales was 58 million, about 89 percent of the UK population. In the associated prison network, there were 71,200 prisoners. Of that, [13,500](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702297/omsq-q4-2017.pdf) were doing time for a sexual offense of some kind. That's about 19 percent of prisoners, or 0.023 percent of the general population.

Why talk about 2017 of all years? It was in 2018 the Ministry of Justice replied to a freedom of information request by reporters at the BBC, revealing that in 2017, to their knowledge, there were 125 trans prisoners in the England and Wales prison system, and of those, [60 were doing time for at least one sexual offense](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42221629). That's 48 percent---higher than the general prison inmate population's sexual offense rate of 19 percent. It's more than double! So, suspicions confirmed?

For many people, the intuitive conclusion at this point was that if trans prisoners are more likely to be sex offenders, trans people are more likely to do sexual offenses. That doesn't actually follow because this difference could just as well be the result of trans people being *less* likely to do any other type of crime. Talking about *proportions* can be very misleading for this reason.

To illustrate this, imagine there's 2 equally-sized groups in a country. The first group has 100 murderers and 100 thieves. The second has 30 murderers and 25 thieves. It would be true to say a higher proportion of the second group's prisoners are murderers. But is the second group more likely to murder? Clearly no. They're less likely to be murder---but they're *even less* likely to steal, meaning a higher portion of their criminals are murderers (30 of 55, instead of 100 of 200).

||image-span

If trans women committed all crimes at the same rate as everyone else *except for murder*, where they instead were much less likely to commit, it would logically follow that they're more likely to be sex offenders. It would also follow they're more likely to commit fraud, and vandalism, and literally every other type of crime that isn't murder. Do you see the problem?

If you wanted to talk about how likely a group is to do a crime in the first place, what you should be talking about is how many times a member of that group does the crime, in comparison with the size of the group. This should be really obvious because that's always how we talk about questions like this in every other context. Think about why this one might be being framed so differently.

So there's 58 million people and 13,500 sex offenders among the general population, and in the trans population there's 125 sex offenders. The missing variable is how many trans people there are.

## How many trans people are there?

In 2018, when this conversation was being pushed, there was no concrete answer for this. The Government Equalities Office [published a fact sheet](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b3a478240f0b64603fc181b/GEO-LGBT-factsheet.pdf) that year where they replied to the question by saying they don't know and pointing out there is no robust data on the total number of trans people, but offering a *tentative* estimate of between 200,000 and 500,000.

||image-span
how-many-trans-ppl.png

A wide range, the UK population at this time was 66.4 million, meaning this estimate was between 0.3 and 0.75 percent of the population. That's in line with many other population estimates I've seen.

We could try to be neutral and just take the midpoint of that, meaning 350,000 people, or 0.5 percent. That's for all of the UK, though, whereas our prison stats are only for England and Wales, so to get an adjusted estimate, multiply that by 0.89 to get 311,500. This would say 0.53 percent of the general population (58.74 million) are trans. Is that accurate? At this point in time, nobody knew for sure, but we didn't really have any better numbers to work with---and the people who were trying to suggest trans people are more likely to be sex offenders didn't even bother using *any* numbers here.

The simplest way to think about this is that 60 trans prisoners being sex offenders out of the 13,500 sex offenders in the general prison population makes trans people 0.444 percent of sex offenders. If trans people are then 0.53 percent of the population, that doesn't show trans over-representation among sex offenders. If the game we're playing is just taking these tentative, government-provided numbers and running with them, the conclusion should've been that trans people are less likely to be criminals in general, and less likely to be sex offenders, too.

||codeblock
general pop. in prison:                         0.12121 percent
  trans pop. in prison:                         0.04012 percent
general pop. in prison with a sexual offense:   0.02298 percent
  trans pop. in prison with a sexual offense:   0.01926 percent

But the fewer trans people exist in society, the higher the percentage of them those 60 sex offenders in prison will represent. For this reason, **if you want trans people to look bad, you need to make the total population of trans people lower**. If you want trans people to look better, you need to make the total number of trans people higher. Since trans sex offenders are 0.444 percent of the total sex offenders, then trans people being greater than 0.444 percent of the population means they're less likely to be sex offenders, and trans people being less than 0.444 percent of the population means they're more likely to be sex offenders. So now it's just a matter of playing with the numbers.

### How can we make trans people look worse?

Let's assume trans men are half the trans population but don't contribute to any of the sexual offenses. In other words, all trans crime is done by trans women. This justifies narrowing our comparison from trans people as a group to only trans women as a group, effectively halving the trans population estimate but doubling the crime rates, because the total crime numbers would be the same. But if we do that, we should also split up the non-trans population by sex. What does that look like?

In a 2017 report on the UK prison population, you can see sexual offenses are 99 percent done by males, with less than 1 percent by females. In Britain, women also generally outnumber men by over a whole percentage point. I can't find exact numbers for 2017, but in the 2021 census, England and Wales had [30.4 million females and 29.2 million males](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/demographics/male-and-female-populations/latest/), so 51 and 49 percent. We can take that and apply it to the 13,500 reported sex offenders to say 13,365 were males and 135 were females, probably. (I'm using this adjusted estimate because I wanted to start with the number of offenders without changing our year---for comparison, in 2016 they did report the gendered values, and the results were 13,808 males and 126 females, which is roughly the same proportion as I ended up with.)

So what percentage of males are sex offenders, and what percentage of females are sex offenders, and then what percentage of trans women are sex offenders (if, for simplicity's sake, we suppose 0 percent of trans men are sex offenders)? It ends up looking like this:

||codeblock
males:   13,365 / 28,815,927 = 0.04638 percent
females:    135 / 29,923,073 = 0.00045 percent
trans women: 60 / ... 

Er, wait---we didn't resolve how many trans women I should assume exist.  The lower number you pick, the higher this percentage ends up being. If we assume the 'worst' and take the lowest point of the estimate, and cut that in half to get only the trans women, that's 100,000, which gives us 0.06 percent. That's higher than the rate for males, and way higher than the rate for females.

||codeblock
males:   13,365 / 28,815,927 = 0.04638 percent
females:    135 / 29,923,073 = 0.00045 percent
trans women: 60 / 100,000    = 0.06000 percent

That's the worst case scenario I can put together using the tentative estimates taken from the UK government. **Would this difference justify anti-trans fear and hatred?** Should women feel cautious or unsafe around trans women because the possibility of her being a sex offender is higher than average by some fraction of a percent? Somehow, no, I don't think you should.

To put the difference in perspective: if you're in a room with 10,000 men and 10,000 trans women, 'statistically' there would be 4 sex offenders in the male group and 6 in the trans women group. I can also safely say that you encounter way more than 1.5 times as many men as trans women throughout your life.

To be fair, it's possible that some people's goal in talking about these numbers is not informing general attitudes about trans people, but a policy discussion about where trans women should be imprisoned. In theory, if every trans woman sent to prison ends up being a sex offender, then it doesn't matter whether trans women are more likely to be sex offenders than average; one could still reason that perhaps we shouldn't let them into women's prisons, if we know they're all sex offenders. That's a thought that a reasonable person, who doesn't hate trans women, could have.

The argument still has problems, which I'll address later---but the problem is how the idea that trans women are more likely to be sex offenders has long since breached the confines of discussions about prison policy and is now just a general anti-transgender talking point.

## Now let's try *not* uncritically accepting the data

It turns out there's a lot of problems in all of the assumptions made so far.

First of all, **how does the prison service even know you're trans?** When you're booked into a prison, they take your ID, and if you're a trans woman and you've had your gender changed legally, to female, as far as the prison service is concerned, you're not trans. You're just a woman. When a reporter asks the prison service about trans prisoners, the answer they give is only people whose legal gender *hasn't* been changed, and as such their express gender identity is different from their legal gender. That is the functional definition of 'trans prisoner'.

It turns out changing your gender in the UK is a time-consuming process that many trans people haven't bothered doing. You've been able to apply for a gender recognition certificate (GRC) since 2004, but by around 2018, [only 8,000 of these things](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-recognition-certificate-applications-and-outcomes/gender-recognition-certificate-applications-and-outcomes#application-outcomes) had been issued in total, ever. This means the total number of trans prisoners with a GRC is presumably low, and their exclusion from the count may be assumed to not make a big difference.

The prison service only realizes and makes note of the fact a person is trans during what's called a case conference. This is when a prisoner meets with numerous prison agents and other people supporting them, which can include people outside the system like a family member, to discuss their needs and their situation. A prison only arranges a case conference if you're going to be in prison for a long time. How long? There doesn't appear to be a set limit, but possibly around 6 months to a year. The result is that if you're in prison for a short time, you may not have a case conference, and may never be counted as a trans prisoner. This means the trans prison population that actually gets recorded is biased toward longer sentence durations---such as for sexual offenses.

**How many of the people we're talking about are actually trans women?** In reply to that freedom of information request in 2018, the prison service doesn't break down those 60 sex offenders by gender. In a [separate document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/663390/noms-offender-equalities-annual-report-2016-2017.pdf) that has nothing to do with sexual offenses, they say of the 125 trans prisoners 23 reported their gender as female and 99 as male. Does that mean 99 trans men, or trans women? Are they self-reporting their gender identity, or their legal gender, or their biological sex? It's actually unclear, even reading the definitions in the footnotes. I checked out the [2016 report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a80dcc0e5274a2e87dbc3bf/prisoner-transgender-statistics-march-april-2016.pdf), which is similarly ambiguous. In [this release from 2022](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/637e38d0e90e0723389cbeb9/HMPPS_Offender_Equalities_2021-22_Report.pdf), after the way this information is recorded had been updated, it says 187 trans inmates claim their legal gender is male, and 168 of those are "transgender females", which it defines as a person who identifies as female but whose legal gender is still male. 43 say their legal gender is female, with 41 self-identifying as "transgender males". The missing numbers are either people who identify as nonbinary or who declined to answer, which became options in 2021.

Unless the ratio flipped over a period of 5 to 6 years---from 80 percent of trans prisoners being trans men in 2016 down to only 20 percent of them in 2022---this would suggest those documents from years earlier were listing self-reported legal gender, meaning it was 99 trans women and 23 trans men. Among that group, there were 60 sexual offenses of some kind. How many trans men were responsible for any of those 60 sexual offenses in 2017? We don't know. That wasn't released. But the point is, it could have been more than zero, couldn't it have? And if it was, that becomes another factor increasing the bias toward a higher sexual offense rate.

Finally, and most importantly: **we're talking about really small sample sizes that fluctuate significantly between years**. This is why people usually talk about averages of ranges of things, because numbers can vary without discernible reason over time. In this case, there was no average, no attempt at normalization---a year was picked essentially at random, and we're extrapolating as though these numbers are *the* numbers. But if we had picked a different year, a very different story could have been told.

For example, the number of trans prisoners in 2017 was 125, but only a year prior, in 2016, [that figure was 70](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a80dcc0e5274a2e87dbc3bf/prisoner-transgender-statistics-march-april-2016.pdf). What happened? Did trans people become almost twice as likely to commit crimes in a year? No, of course not. And if it were consistently 48 percent of trans prisoners who are sex offenders, that would've meant in 2016 there would be 33 trans prisoners with sex offenses, not 60. That would have completely deflated all the alarmist anti-trans articles written about this, because even with the most uncharitable assumptions this would've been well below the general rate.

So why did we go with the 2017 numbers? Was this a critical point in time, or deemed more important or telling than any other year? No. There was no particular reason. That's just when *Fair Play For Women* was talking about the issue, so that's when somebody from the BBC asked the Ministry of Justice what their numbers were, so that's the year the Ministry answered about. Now imagine if there's also a completely different story depending on where in the world you're making this comparison. Are England's numbers going to be the same as the numbers in Italy? Sweden? Ecuador?

From the first section this argument seemed obviously shaky, but taking these points into account results in the whole narrative falling apart.

## A new variation appears

This argument had been around for a few years when I saw Elon Musk, our modern Thomas Edison stroke Joseph Goebbels, share a post that included some even more unfavorable numbers than I was used to. It relied on claiming there were only 48,000 trans women in the UK, resulting in a very high sexual offense rate, though still pulling from the prison stats from years prior. Where did this come from?

||image-span 400
elon-musk-2025-09-05.png

In 2021, two countries, the UK and Canada, both did their national census and became the first countries to attempt measuring how many trans people exist.

* [Canada asked two questions](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/statcan/98-500-x/98-500-x2021014-eng.pdf): sex at birth (as they always asked), and gender identity, a new field. They could then count how many people answered these differently.
* The UK asked your basic info, [then also asked](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/genderidentity/bulletins/genderidentityenglandandwales/census2021): is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?

Both approaches were [criticized](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3030519849o), because you can never please everyone, and you can especially never please the queer community. It's possible people with poor English skills misunderstood the way these questions were phrased. But for the first time this at least gave us something concrete to work with, instead of always working with tentative extrapolation, even if the resulting data is faulty. I'm sure we'll get more accurate measures in the future. For now, here's what we ended up with:

* In the UK, 262,000 people answered yes, their gender identity is different from their sex at birth. In a country of 67 million, this means about 0.4 percent are trans, on the low side of that estimated range the government had provided years earlier (0.3 to 0.75 percent).
* In Canada, the result was 120,720 people. In a country of 38.2 million, this gave us 0.31 percent of the country. Broken down by province, the highest reported amount was in Nova Scotia, a small eastern province, while in Ontario, the by-far most-populous province, you see numbers roughly the same as the national average. In Quebec, the second-most populous, it's a bit lower, while in BC, the third-most populous, it's a bit higher.

Think about what might be happening in a census. It's possible to over-report things sometimes, as there might be somebody who just marks yes for no reason despite not really being that committed to living as trans. This is also the case for prisoners self-reporting their identity, though.

But I expect false negatives are going to be more numerous. I'd predict and expect the number of trans people on a national census to be biased toward a lower number, not a higher one, because of the presence of cultures that were highly prejudiced against such an identity, where even just being gay or bi could more or less destroy your life. This was the case in our society generations ago and is still the case with various immigrant cultures.

The most undistorted number is probably going to be among the population that's least closed-off to the possibility, where people are most able to express as trans if that's what they are. Today that probably means younger people whose parents were born in the country, or something like that. And over time I'd expect the general percentage to drift toward that subset.

I could turn out to be wrong about that, but I thought I'd share my interpretation of these results.

**Even if we don't assume this number is under-reported at all and just roll with it, that doesn't answer where they got 48,000 from.** The answer is that in the UK census, if you answer yes to the first question, you're offered an optional follow-up: what *is* your gender? There was an empty box where you could write in anything, or nothing. It was optional. Of the 262,000 people who said they were trans in some way, only 48,000 specifically wrote in the term "trans woman". We don't know how many people wrote "woman", which is probably what I'd have written---but we do know that of the total count, of the 262,000 people who answered saying they were trans, over 100,000 didn't bother writing in anything at all in that space. Do they not count? To take that 48,000 as the 'real' value of trans women is obviously absurd.

The kind of person who makes a picture like this is motivated to make trans people look bad, not to portray the truth as clearly as possible. They saw an opportunity to twist the facts, to make trans women look bad by using this misleading figure, and they took it.

## Is this a real issue?

Most of the people who amplify this "trans women are sex offenders" narrative are doing so because they hate trans women and they want you to hate us too. They try to do this by making trans women seem like a threat to cis women, whom they want to gallantly defend. It might not surprise you to learn transphobia is much less common in women. It's mostly men who are so gravely concerned about all this.

But there are some people operating out of genuine fear---including the women who do end up getting sucked into all this. They're afraid of being abused by men, and to some of them, trans women appear simply as males who might abuse them---or, they see that most trans women aren't the same as men, but they're nervous that policies meant to accommodate trans women will create vulnerabilities in our systems that other men could misuse. And it's understandable that women are protective of female spaces.

There is a respectable position on prisons born out of real concern about women inmates. The question is simply whether simply letting anybody who claims to be trans join a women's prison might be a bad policy that leads to bad outcomes. It could be unfair to women. Is it?

If you haven't spent much time looking into it, you might think trans women are just moved into women's prisons at their own request without having to prove or demonstrate anything, because that's exactly what anti-trans groups try to imply. They want us to imagine that a prisoner can just raise their hand and say "I'm a woman now" and the government takes you at your word and throws you in with the girls. If that were the case, I think most people would agree there's a problem.

In 2022 there were 187 trans women in prison. Of those, [6 had been moved to female prisons](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/637e38d0e90e0723389cbeb9/HMPPS_Offender_Equalities_2021-22_Report.pdf). The decision to move them is made only after a case conference and after risk assessment on a case-by-case basis. There is no policy of automatically letting all trans women into women's prisons. It's made up. This is not a widespread problem.

There *have* been some mishandled cases, though---like in 2018, a 52-year-old male was allowed to move into a female prison, [only to assault another inmate and get transferred back to male prison a few months later](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/11/karen-white-how-manipulative-and-controlling-offender-attacked-again-transgender-prison). That was obviously a mistake in judgement by whoever was in charge. Anti-trans activists used this person's photograph to make frightening propaganda. But they're amplifying this one case to make the issue seem way bigger than it really is, and they know that.

Have some more faith in the people who run our prisons. It turns out they're not stupid.

By the way, when I was looking at Canada's census results, I was curious if things were being inflated by the First Nations population being more likely to identify as nonbinary, since that's a phenomenon associated with their cultures ('two-spirit'), though I don't know much about it or how prevalent it is.

Still, I took available data for Canadian provinces and territories [by percentage of population with First Nation identity](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/abo-aut/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&S=99) to sort the census data on self-reported trans identity by Aboriginal percentage. The result is you don't see noticeably more people self-identifying as trans in the regions with more Aboriginal people.
