# The default politician

||date
2024-11-26

Now that the election is over, let's talk about something. Close your eyes and think 'politician'. I bet you think of a white guy---probably in his 40s or 50s, and with a simple first name, something like John, Rob, Scott, James, Rick. It *can* be less common, but nothing that people will mispronounce---or worse yet be *corrected* about the pronunciation of. And he just looks normal. Clean-cut, short hair, suit and tie. Not too effeminate. Not somebody who crossdresses on weekends. Not too gruff either. He shouldn't look like a construction worker. But not too effeminate. We need a normal, balanced amount of masculinity. A dad, a young grandpa.

The further you stray from the default template, the more you have to justify yourself, the more you have to compensate for. It's not impossible to get elected as something else, but if there's nothing remarkable about you, nothing really above-average that you bring to the table, then people are just going to elect the normal white guy instead. I hope that I can trust you to understand I'm not saying this is how it ought to be. It just is. The electorate has a normal-white-guy bias.

If you're a gay dude, then you better be the best goddamn gay around. A model gay. Bonus if you're the kind of person we can't even tell is gay at first, and who doesn't weird anyone out. But even this is a tall order to justify. Some people will just plainly not support you if they know you're out there man-bedding. In the US today, the go-to example of a gay politician has become Pete Buttigieg. He even has a simple-enough first name. Pete. His surname is a little stupid, and people can't figure out how to pronounce it just by looking. It also sounds too much "booty-judge", which invites right-wingers to make jokes about him judging booties, because he's gay. Then again, they find something stupid to attach to most people. Gavin Newsom is Gavin New-scum, I guess? The actual pronunciation is more boot-a-jedge. It's a good strategy that he emphasizes his first name with that 'Mayor Pete' nickname. Try to reduce how much people have to think about the buttagidige part at the end. But is this guy exceptionally great? Enough so that people will elect him despite him being gay? No, probably not. He's kind of just a normal guy, but worse, because he's gay. It's a downgrade. He doesn't bring enough to compensate for his gayness.

Now if you're black, you have a very high bar to get over. You have to be very wholesome and family-oriented. Nothing scary. No rap music. No Islam, for Christ's sake. You have to be a Christian. Emphasize that shit. Say something about Jesus and going to church. And don't cheat on your wife, or have children with multiple women. The day a black man tries to run for president and it turns out he has kids from multiple women, like current president, I promise you the media will call them his 'baby mommas' at every opportunity, everybody will pretend they're not being racist, and suddenly the public will remember they care about family values again. Remember those?

It's also better if your wife is a black woman. Americans are more comfortable with black people when they're in same-race relationships, because that prevents any kind of weirdness. No weird dynamics. No white men feeling he's taking one of ours. I think even the black voters like it better this way too, actually. I don't mean they'll tell you that they like it, if you ask them. I just mean it sells better. If you did want to sell a politician in an interracial relationship to the American public, it should probably be a white man with a woman who's any race other than East Asian, because sometimes people are weird about that. A black, Middle Eastern, or Indian woman is fine.

Barack Obama walked the line. He was highly educated, a great speaker, he had experience in state and federal politics, he had a good home life with a normal marriage to a black woman, two kids and a dog. Went to law school, became a senator, then became a senator again but this time at a different level of government. Funny enough, his worst quality was probably his name, which people did try to use against him, but at least it wasn't something hard to pronounce. His middle name just *sounded* sort of like that terrorist dude, which was played aganst him, but it wasn't enough to stop him. And his first name, Barack? It's uncommon, but it's also relatively simple, and it actually has a good ring to it. Barack Obama. It rolls off the tongue well. It sounds like 'rock'. If you didn't already know it as the name of a president, it almost sounds like it could've been a guy from an action movie.

$To be a woman is also a difficult balancing act. We've seen successful female politicians in other countries. To make it big-time, they have to be tough enough to be taken seriously, but communicate in a soft enough way they don't get called a shrill bitch, and they can't be too sexy or come off as too emotional. No crying in public. Unless your family dies or something, in which case you're allowed to shed some tears, but not full-on sobbing. They have to be dignified, funeral tears. A female politician has to be a ruthless grandmother of the nation. Angela Merkel (Germany), Margaret Thatcher (UK), and Indira Gandhi (India) are some good examples of this.

If she's too attractive, that actually works against her, because men won't take a woman seriously as an authority figure if they also want to bang her. They'll just say she's hot and they want to sleep with her, but this is intended as a way of being belittling or demeaning. We've seen this over and over again with politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example. If you ask people what they think of her, people answer by talking about her appearance, instead of their thoughts about her as a serious politician, and the signal is they *don't* think of her as a serious politician.

There are sometimes young women who end up as heads of government in other countries, but usually ones that are especially forward-thinking compared with America, and who have a governmental system where the leader is less emphasized in elections. Jacinda Ardern, the PM of New Zealand, for example, was not directly voted in, and I doubt a woman like her could've been successful in American politics, at least without totally changing her approach.

Hillary Clinton was a highly competent woman who'd proved herself many times over and captured that 'tough grandmother' energy reasonably well. There are few women in America who had as much potential to become the first female president. It took a lot of effort and resources to keep her down, especially in lies and conspiracy theories in the right-wing media circus that focused on her, and managed to trick enough people into thinking she did something wrong in Benghazi, and then had an email server, and maybe was orchestrating a pedophile sex-cult out of a pizzeria? Despite all that, she got more votes than her opponent and *almost* got elected, because in most ways she did fit the role well.

## Kamala Harris

Now let's talk about Harris. She's part-Indian, part-African American, part white, so she's only like a quarter black or something. Does that matter? No, obviously it shouldn't---but people talked about it during election season. It was a topic of conversation. That's a downside of being non-white, sadly. This topic doesn't do anything productive, and of course nobody wastes any time talking about a white guy's race. Does anyone care what country Tim Walz's parents came from? Is he Irish? Is one of his parents from Denmark? I don't know, or care, and I doubt anyone else does either.

But what people really dislike is ambiguity. If you're black, then you need to clearly be black and lean into being black and make that part of your story. If you're Indian, then likewise. There are, in fact, people who didn't realize Harris was black until the 2024 race. And even after this became a conversation, Harris just tried to avoid the topic entirely. She was asked about it in an interview, and she just called talking about her race a tired talking point, and asked to move to the next question. In my view, this shows her poor understanding of the American electorate. She needed to tell her story. Tell us where your parents came from, talk about your past.

For many people, the lack of clear backstory, and the appearance of a *changing* backstory, contributed to the perception that she was inauthentic. There were people who criticized her for claiming to be black despite only being a quarter black and not having "the black experience" (there were black people who believed and argued this).

I saw many Harris supporters make the mistake of insisting on the pronunciation of her name, making that into a bigger deal than it ever should've been. "It's not kuh-malla, it's comma-luh". Terrible. Way to shoot yourselves in the foot. If I could've given everybody advice: just say Harris. It's the better part of her name, and there's no reason not to use it. If I were on her staff, any time I *could* just be saying 'Harris' instead, I'd do that and just skip the Kamala part; and then when people *do* say Kamala, let them pronounce it however they want. Who cares?

### What did Harris have to compensate for these disadvantages?

Unfortunately, Harris does not at all have tough grandma vibes. Is she too young? Maybe it's about how she talks. People don't like how she sounds, or how she laughs. Either way, she doesn't have the right vibe. She feels more like a classmate at college than a wise no-nonsense grandma.

What's her experience like? Senator from California, then Vice President. That's reasonable, you say. But right now, California has a bad reputation nationally. Not a bad reputation it *deserves*, but one that it got because people see news reports about how there are homeless people shitting on the streets in San Francisco. Line-ups of homeless tents! And oh, the crime! We've all seen those videos on the internet of people looting stores and nobody stopping them, right?

There was a referendum (prop 47 in 2014)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_California_Proposition_47#References) to reclassify petty theft at some point and the people of the state voted in favour of it, which didn't work out, which is why now they've passed another referendum (prop 36 in 2024)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_California_Proposition_36#References) reversing some of that change. So despite California being the wealthiest state with a really high quality of living where people all across the country would be happy to move to if they could afford it, a lot of people across America hear 'government of California' and think bad thoughts. (This will be a hurdle for Gavin Newsom if he tries to break into national politics---they'll just talk about California's problems constantly, and the narrative will be *California bad, therefore Newsom bad*.)

Before being a Senator, Harris was an Attorney General. What does that even mean? She was in charge of laws being enforced in California? That's bad, because in California they have bad laws and people do bad things and they get away with it because California is bad. So that's all just bad.

Then she was the Vice President for 4 years. That must be valuable experience, right? Unfortunately, the way a lot of people reason is "if my life is going well, I support the current leadership, and if my life feels like it's going poorly, then I don't support the current leadership". Is it their fault? Were there things they could've done but didn't? It doesn't matter. The reasoning doesn't run that deep. Lots of Americans thought the economy felt bad, so they don't like the current leadership, and Harris *is* the current leadership, therefore she's bad and that political experience amounts to nothing, or less than nothing. They would've preferred Harris in an alternate timeline where she was never VP to the Harris in our timeline where she was. It tainted her.

Is the economy *actually* doing worse? I don't even know. There's indicators to suggest it's not, but people will say they *feel* the economy is doing bad no matter what the numbers say. It's actually largely psychological, not mathematical. There are various biases and ideas that go into how well people think the economy is doing, and part of it is messaging. If every day you turn on TV and the people on air tell you "the economy is bad", then you're just going to end up feeling like the economy is bad, regardless of your personal experiences with it. A similar thing happens with crime rates.

There was that whole "border czar" lie that Harris's campaign didn't do enough to contradict. And the border is another feels-based topic, where virtually nobody has any idea what the border is like---most people in the country are nowhere near it and don't interact with it, so what do they know? Whatever the press shows them, is the answer. But somehow, everybody ended up *feeling* like the border is a big problem right now---and if things are bad, then your current leaders must be to blame. And there was an article a few years ago where some journalist called Harris the border czar, which must mean the border is her fault, maybe? It's brilliant, in an evil sort of way.

(Harris was tasked with diplomatic missions related to immigration, which were arguably successful. [It was never her job to directly do anything about the border.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/kamala-harris-chose-a-long-term-approach-when-tasked-to-tackle-rise-in-border-crossings) That whole narrative was just made up by the right-wing media.)

So experience and personality weren't in her favour. What *was*?

Nothing, really. Everything I know about her cast her in a negative light in the public's eye. And that doesn't mean she would've been a bad executive. She probably would've been the best president the US has had in some time. But she's a woman, she's black or something, she talks weird, she has a weird name that people mispronounce. That's a lot to compensate for. For somebody like her to get in, she'd have needed to be exceptionally great, and she wasn't.

## Joe Biden

Now look at Joe Biden. He was a great candidate, both on paper and in practice---well, before he became President, at least.

||image-box

First of all, he's a normal white guy with a simple name. He fits the model. There's nothing to compensate for. His name is Joe. It's literally the name that we use to mean a simple everyday guy. He's just an ordinary Joe. Joe Sixpack. Joe Shmoe.

Then you look at him, and yeah, there's really nothing weird about him at all. He's perfectly fucking normal. He's from a working class area, then he worked in government for a long time, and everybody who's worked with or around him speaks positively of him, including his opponents. People liked him as VP. He's seriously great. The fact he's had such a difficult time speaking in the last few years is pretty much his only downside.

**In every respect other than being younger, the move from Joe to Kamala was one of the worst downgrades of all time.** That's what I thought, anyway. At the time, many people seemed to be happy with the change-up, but only because they were happy to feel they had 'solved' the Joe Biden problem.

That's why Tim Walz was important. He distracted everybody from Harris. Tim was like the new Joe: a normal, friendly, white guy with a simple name. Tim. He's Tim. He was a high school football coach, for cryin' out loud. And he had political experience. The vibes were immaculate. He's all the things Harris lacked, but which people were too uncomfortable to acknowledge Harris lacked, because people don't usually speak as frankly as I'm doing here.

## The NDP: a similar tale

In Canada, the two big parties are the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. In the 1960s, a third party called the New Democratic Party (NDP) was founded. Under the leadership of **Jack Layton**, a normal white guy with a simple name, it actually grew a lot in the early 2000s, culminating in the 2011 general election, where they took seats from the Liberals and the Bloc Québécois, another smaller party. It was their best performance ever, and the Liberal Party's worst performance ever, and the NDP went from 4th to the 2nd largest party in the country, after the Conservatives. Layton was seated as the Official Opposition. This was a huge moment for them, and for Canadian politics in general.

Jack Layton had some of the same energy and appeal as Bernie Sanders, in that he was an old white guy who came off as principled, authentic, and caring. He was also an effective politician, genuinely trying to expand and grow the party. He was normal, he was a good speaker, he went on the streets and talked with people. He didn't do anything stupid or controversial. Even relatively apolitical people in my life knew about him and had a good impression of him.

Then tragically, he died. The year before the election, in 2010, he had cancer, but he seemed to recover. He became the Opposition Leader in May 2011. In July, he announced that he had another, different type of cancer, and then in August he was pronounced dead. We never found out what type of cancer it was, and it doesn't matter. As far as politicians go, this man was beloved. Everybody mourned.

Fast-forward to today, and the NPD is back to being 4th largest in the House of Commons. In the 2015 general, the Liberal Party came back stronger than ever under Justin Trudeau's leadership. They went from 36 seats to a majority with 184 seats. The NPD lost more than half of theirs. And while they tried for a round with Tom Mulcair in between, for the last 7 years now the NPD party leader has been a man named **Jagmeet Singh**. This is one of the major reasons this party no longer stands a chance. The downgrade from Jack Layton to Singh is enormous.

||image-box
9-5.png|Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, pictured speaking in 2024

If you just read his name in your head for the first time, you probably mispronounced it. It's not 'jag-meet', it's 'jug-meet'. Take some meat, put it in a jug, and then it sings to us. Jug meat sing. That's his name. It's a terrible name, almost comically terrible. He's also a Sikh, which is some foreign religion that most of us know nothing about. He gets on stage with a big beard and turban. I'm sorry, but what do you expect running a leader like this?

Part of the reason a white guy with a simple name is the default in politics is that people want their leaders to represent them, not only in policy but in who they are. I'd say our current and previous PMs, Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper, both achieved that. If you put them on stage internationally, I'd say they're both fine reflections of what Canada is as a nation. Singh is not.

Singh isn't an immigrant. He was born in Ontario. That means he speaks normally, at least. If he were serious about becoming a leader in national politics, he should ditch Sikhism, get a normal haircut, and either convert to Christianity or just say he's not religious and avoid the topic. He could've been successful as a normal Canadian guy, except that his skin is a bit darker because he came from an immigrant background. That can work. In his current state, though? It doesn't look like he even wants to represent Canada. It doesn't look like he's serious about ever actually winning. That or he's hopelessly naïve about how politics works, and he thinks if he says the right things he'll somehow overcome all of his own electoral disadvantages. He won't.

I actually doubt he'd win even if he took all of my advice, because there's probably nothing particularly great about him. If you want to win and you're not a normal white guy, you need to be a cut above, you need to stand out and be better than average. And Singh probably isn't.

In the United States, I'm skeptical of third parties because I think they've ended up having motives other than trying to actually win office. They know they can't, but run anyway for the impact their run has on the election, trying to spoil the race by 'taking' votes from the candidate most similar to you, or just using the platform you get by running for office to expand on your own brand and personality in other ways. It becomes a weird grift, a performance art.

Is that what happened to Singh and the NPD internally? Did they give up on ever actually winning federally and just decide they may as well embrace being the progressive-minded left-leaning minority party that gets to make statements to the press, but never has to actually govern? That's why they would tolerate being led by Singh, who scores many progressive 'points' (look at us, we're so forward-thinking that we chose a Sikh with a beard and turban as our leader!) and will never win anything.

I don't know. I'm not privy to internal NPD party politics. It's just a thought.

By the way, the best politician ever was John Tory, the former mayor of Toronto. That guy is like if space aliens were trying to disguise theirselves as a politician. He's the most normal-looking person ever, and his name is literally John Tory. The most common first name, followed by Tory---a man born destined for politics. Talk about people made in a lab. (He wasn't terrible.)
