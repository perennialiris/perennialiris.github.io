# India |2024-03-05

That disagreement among the American right about H-1B visas earlier this year triggered a flare-up of anti-Indian racism. If you browsed social media at that time, you could hardly avoid white people talking about how much they hate Indians, talking about curry, poor English skills, tech support, making fun of Indian stereotypes about being bad at sex or flirting---or in some cases going on deranged rants about how Indians are mentally inferior and do their jobs by memorizing a flow-chart of algorithmic instructions they carry out without a deep understanding of what they're doing or why, like ants following a pheromone trail.

This prejudice has been around for a while and it seems to keep getting louder. It's like people don't learn racism is bad so much as they learn to stop being racist toward specific groups of people. They're racist against, say, black people, until they learn about and humanize them and realize how stupid it is to hold individuals to the prejudice of group averages---but then a Chinese person comes along, and it starts all over, until they learn that racism against Chinese people is bad. They don't transfer these lessons between groups.

India is a great civilization with a lot to appreciate, so if you don't know much about it, then I welcome you to join me in walking through some basic information and an overview of modern Indian history.

To stereotype or hold generalizations about India is kind of insane. The place is enormous and incredibly diverse. It would be like meeting somebody from Ireland, interpreting that as 'Europe', and talking about corruption in Poland, or that time you went to Spain. India has about twice the population of Europe (and over four times that of the United States). And though its total land area is less than Europe, it's still much bigger than some people seem to realize. It stretches from London to Moscow, from Athens to Oslo.

And these people don't speak the same language. India technically has hundreds, though only a dozen or so are spoken by more than one percent of the population. Still, there is no single Indian language or Indian accent any more than there is a European language or accent. The most popular language, Hindi, is only spoken by about a quarter of the population.

India also has substantial religious diversity, not only in number of religions, but in how different these religions are from each other. It was the birthplace of four major world religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism), and their society has been significantly influenced by Islam after Muslims came to the region from the Middle East in the 13th century. Today India has over 200 million Muslims, making it one of the top countries in the world by Muslim population---and that's only 15 percent of 1.4 billion.

For hundreds of years, India was a land of religious pluralism, with Muslims, Hindus, and other groups working alongside one another in government, and the emperor patronizing multiple religions. Akbar (r. 1556--1605), one of the early Mughal emperors, was said to have personally held a combination of religious beliefs, as he oversaw the expansion and centralization of the multi-religious empire that Europeans would come to know. As the Mughal Empire, India had become the wealthiest place in the world---though this position wouldn't last. It was in the early modern period that a lot of great Mughal architecture was built, like the Taj Mahal, built in the mid-1600s by order of Shah Jahan (r. 1628--1658).

The country was not officially called India back then, but the Delhi Sultanate, meaning the rule of the sultan from his seat in Delhi, their capital city, which is still their capital city today. That name is similar, in form, to the Roman Empire, meaning rule of the emperor from the city of Rome. They sometimes used the term Hindustan, which referred to the northern part of the subcontinent, where the majority population was Hindu; but later in the period, this name was used generally as a term for everything ruled by Delhi. This reminds me of how England originally meant the southern part of Great Britain, populated by Anglos, but centuries later, people would say Britain to mean both Britain and anything ruled by Britain. In some international treaties, England was used as a byword for what we today call the United Kingdom, or even the entire British Empire.

You may recognize the name Akbar from the phrase *Allahu akbar*, Arabic for god is great, or god is the greatest. This is because 'Akbar' was not his birth name, but a title that literally means 'the great'. This is similar to how we most know the first Roman emperor as 'Augustus', which was also not his birth name, but a title given to him later in life, meaning 'the great' or perhaps 'the majestic'. In some English texts, Akbar is referred to as Akbar the Great, even though this is redundant. He is also called Akbar I.

It was near the end of Akbar's reign (the late 1500s) that British traders first landed in India. They didn't arrive as conquerers, but as humble traders. Nor could they have conquered anybody if they wanted to---they were smaller, less wealthy, less powerful, and far from home, in the domain of powerful, wealthy, centralized Asian empires. The English had to seek permission from the Indian emperor to trade on his land, and meet his demands to attain that permission (for example, there was a ban on Christian missionaries). It wouldn't be until over 100 years later that England even began having any real power in the region as India started going through their own 'fall of Rome' that created opportunity for new alliances to appear. Many Indian princes and governors would choose to ally with British and French officers rather than with other Indian states. By this point Europeans had been there for generations---there was not a clear nativist divide by which Europeans were 'foreigners', nor a unified 'Indian' identity among the rest of the subcontinent to exclude them from.

Europe, and Britian especially, was significantly affected by this imperial relationship with India. Now its rulers, the British continued purchasing Indian goods---textiles, dyes, tea (before the British were associated with tea, coffee was the drink of choice, but a changing world economic landscape that made coffee more expensive followed by Indian tea being in plentiful supply got most of the country to change over, and Britons have been portrays as tea-drinkers ever since)---and there was a mutual interest in each other's culture. Indian writers and artists travelled to England and vice versa. The British Raj became a laboratory for European governance. There are things normal to us now---like our public school systems, or the very notion of a public cemetery---that originate among British governors in India. During this time, words from numerous Indian languages also became English loanwords, some of which you probably wouldn't have guessed: mantra, guru, avatar, and karma (those all have a sort of Indian feel), but also khaki, bungalow, cot (a portable bed), bandana, pundit, punch (as in fruit punch), thug (from the *thuggee*, the name of robber-gangs who attacked travellers), loot (as in to steal), tank (as in tank of water, and later military tanks), and shampoo.

There was also chauvinism on the part of many Britons, who viewed their culture as better than the culture of India. The more progressive Whigs in Britain at the time were perhaps most guilty of this, viewing their Enlightenment thinking as something that put them ahead of the rest of the world. Thomas Macaulay (muh-coh-lee), a British politician who played a major role in India's education policy, infamously wrote that a single bookshelf of a European library was worth more than all literature in India, and Asia, and Arabia, put together. This feeling of enlightened superiority was used partly to *justify* British rule. "Why is Britain ruling over this other country?" is a question the public would want an answer to, and Britain had, at this time, a self-image of being an enlightened country that would deliver good governance, and the saving faith of Christianity. To fulfil this narrative, they had to think India would be terribly mismanaged without them, and one of the ways they did this was by outlawing certain types of barbarism---most memorably, sati.

Sati is an ancient concept: when a married man died, we throw his body on a funeral pyre, and then we throw his wife on there too, burning her alive. Why in the world would any culture do something like this? It sounds obviously antithetical to any sort of community. Perhaps it was only in special circumstances as some kind of ritual; perhaps it was voluntary but women had no options other than and it was just a form of honorable suicide, but then people venerated it culturally. Perhaps it wasn't even really a thing, and people just mistranslated old texts that had something to do with widows and funeral pyres. There's debate to what extent sati happened, in what circumstances, and for what reason---but the point here is that at the time Britain 'banned' it, no European had ever witnessed sati happening. It was something they heard rumours of, and then proudly declared they were going to restrict going into the future. This was presented to the British public as an example of the moral defecit of the Indian population and a moral victory by the British, a demonstration of our superiority. And the legacy of this propaganda---the *idea* that Indians were burning women alive before the good British came and put a stop to it---has lived on in people's minds to this day, hundreds of years later.

In the intervening period, religious tension in India grew, largely as a result of British policy meant to pit them against each other. Divide and conquer---everywhere that Britain ruled, they identified the groups within the population, granted privileges to one over the other, and navigated the resulting conflicts to their advantage. They would prefer, for instance, if instead of everybody uniting against the British, the Muslims would view the Hindus as a greater threat to them, and for the Muslims to cozy up with the British government against the Hindus instead. But this being the attitude of the ruling class for so many generations contributed to the religious divide that exists in India today, which is a sad change from India's own history.

$As time went by, and the world economic system changed to be one largely of free trade between nations, the benefit of maintaining large empires was dwindling, while the cost of keeping colonies under your thumb was only getting higher---as people grew discontent with being ruled from afar, and became interested in local autonomy. Even if opposition to colonial rule *could* be stopped---and in the beginning, it was---eventually it may end up being so expensive to continually do so that it's just not worth it anymore. By the 1900s, Britain was at peace with the reality that their empire was not going to last forever, and they shifted to building diplomatic ties and developing what we now know as the Commonwealth. It was also this century that Canada would gain full independence, likewise without any great fight by England.

The movement for independence being led by Mahatma Gandhi, whose strategy of nonviolent resistance the British were unable to put down without sacrificing any semblance of moral high ground, impacted how we in the West see protest and political change. Gandhi was admired in Britain, America, and elsewhere. He was directly cited as an influence on the US civil rights movement decades later. However, his spiritual influence on the direction of the nation notwithstanding, Gandhi was never directly involved in politics. He had no impact on law, government, or India's foreign affairs.

To understand that side of things, look to **Jawaharlal Nehru**, an Indian man who studied law in England, attended Cambridge, and travelled across Europe before returning to India and becoming involved in politics in the 1920s. He later served as India's first Prime Minister after independence in 1947, a position he held until his death in 1964. Nehru, more than anybody else, molded India as the country we know today.

When India was in the process of becoming independent, it also underwent partition. The Muslim population of India, led by the great **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**, believed that after the British left, the Muslim population would be marginalized in a Hindu-majority India, and that for their own sake, the Muslims ought to declare independence, creating Pakistan. Jinnah died in 1948, only a year after his vision became reality, and he is now revered in Pakistan as father of the nation. There were calls in India to pursue a similar path and become an explicitly religious country, a Hindustan. Nehru rejected this. Though he was from a Hindu family, Nehru was not a religious man, and he believed that India was home to many different peoples and religions, including Muslims. Despite their new neighbours declaring their countries Islamic states, Nehru stood as a defender of secularism, religious pluralism, and humanism.

Nehru and his party were socialists, but they deliberately avoided aligning too strongly with either side during the Cold War, which is probably why many in the West don't associate India with socialism, despite this being one of the express goals of their government for decades. Nehru didn't full agree with the Marxist approach that had taken over Russia, and later China. What he did believe in was national independence, and democracy. Whereas in Russia, China, and other Second World countries, Communist parties came to power by coup and crushed any semblance of democracy, Nehru was always freely and fairly elected, and instead of taking the excuse that India wasn't ready for democracy---because most of its population was illiterate, living in rural areas with no knowledge of politics---they sought to change their conditions, massively improving their literacy rate and organizing groups to go across the country, village by village, educating people about government, elections, and providing information about political parties and candidates. This undertaking is not as widely known of and celebrated as it should be, and it's the reason that today India can boast being the world's largest democracy.

There was conflict about what India's official language for business and politics should be after independence. They tried to make it Hindi, the most popular language, but this led to violent conflict, especially in the south with the Tamils. It was seen as too much favouring the Hindi-speaking population. As a compromise, they settled on English also being an option, so they could learn that instead of Hindi. This compromise is still in place; the Indian House of Commons (called the Lok Sabha) is conducted in a combination of Hindi and English.

The next big leader of India after Nehru was Indira Gandhi, who first became Prime Minister in 1966 (no relation to Mahatma Gandhi---there were other families with that surname). Now largely associated with Margaret Thatcher, the "Iron Lady" was first a term applied to Indira. It was around the beginning of her tenure that India went through its own Green revolution, as high-yield variety seeds and mechanized farming equipment massively increased agricultural output, changing the country's economic landscape. India was trying to balance economic interests with their goal of sovereignty and self-sufficiency, which a modernizing economy appeared to threaten. The world economy was transitioning into the neoliberal ideas of the 1970s, foreign companies became interested in Indian agriculture, and control of land and capital began accumulating to the detriment of the small farmer. This was still limited at the time, as India had been very protectionist for decades.

Indira's rule was cut short when she was assassinated in 1984 by Sikh men who had been working as her bodyguards. **Sikhism** is a minority religion in India, commonly associated with their turbans and beards, which are considered holy in the Sikh religion. They make up around 1 and a half percent of India's population---though for perspective, that's still tens of millions of people, larger than Romania, Chile, or the Netherlands. Often overlooked for being far smaller than the Hindu or Muslim populations, the Sikh population is most concentrated a the northern Indian region called the Punjab. There is a Sikh nationalist movement which calls for this region, the only place in the world where Sikhs are the majority, to be given political independence in the same way that Pakistan was. They refer to this proposed region as Khalistan, derived from *Khalsa*, which refers to followers of Sikhism who have been properly initiated, like if there were a term for Christians who have been baptized. I mention this because the Khalistan movement is relevant to modern politics: if you heard about how the Indian government killed a man in Canada in 2023, named Hardeep Singh Nijjar, it's because this man was a Sikh leader who supported the Khalistan movement, which the present-day Indian government strongly opposes.

The Sikh religion has a holy site called the golden temple (which is indeed covered in real gold leaf). There were some people wanted by the Indian government, they hid in this temple, but Indira Gandhi signed the order to have the army attack the place and apprehend them, despite its religious significance. They also attacked various other Sikh temples. The Sikhs were armed and fought back, and it became a much worse conflict than anticipated, and gravely offended Sikhs everywhere, including the two in her employ who shot her. They were both caught and executed. (For more about this topic, search Operation Blue Star.)

$After Indira Gandhi's death, India would significantly change course. They embraced economic liberalization more fully, started building an urban middle class, and invested in education and especially in the computer technology sector---the origin story of the stereotypical "Indian tech support" that Americans know today. For the most part, this change in strategy was a big success.

India's population in 1900 was about 400 million. It only exploded to over a billion in the last hundred years. At some point, the population growth outpaced infrastructure development, and as a result many Indian homes lacked toilets. This resulted in a stereotype about Indians and public defecation, with racists calling them 'street-shitters'---but this is also a problem in many other developing countries, in impoverished regions in southern Asia, China, Africa, South America, and even in some American cities. What do you think people did before toilets? And what do you think everybody here would resort to if all of our plumbing suddenly disappeared? India just gets this special attention and ridicule because certain people hate Indians and in this observation feel they found an insult that sticks. It's a problem they're aware of and trying to address, and a problem that doesn't actually affect some areas (depends on where in India you go), but the racist fixation with it is beyond stupid.

In recent years, India overtook China to be the world's most populous country. And unlike China, it hasn't closed itself off from the rest of the world's internet. As their population becomes more internet-connected, your internet experience will become affected by the presence of Indian users---in a way it's *not* affected by the presence of Chinese users, who are hidden away on their own websites, can't access any of ours, and far less likely to speak English. For humanity, this is a great thing. The ability to be so directly connected with people on the other side of the world is an incredible privilege that all generations before us could only dream of. And for world politics, the fact India has not gone fully down the path of China continues to be a great relief. India has some important similarities with China---a developing country with an insanely large population, mostly---but is less antagonistic, more open to working with us, and way more comfortable with Western notions of freedom and democracy. It's possible for us to make conflict with them and push them away, but our goal should be the opposite. We should very much desire to be friends with this country if we can.

There are many Indians today who are aware of the bad impressions and poor reputation some of their people have been giving their country internationally. They're self-aware of their own problems. They're embarrassed by some of their own countrymen and they want to be better. Even if you've personally had some negative experiences with an Indian immigrant or two, remember that you're talking about a population four times the size of America. I wouldn't say that I hate Americans if I had a bad experience with one, or even a dozen of them. There are many different types of Americans, different regions within America, different subcultures, different religions, different politics, different personalities, different ways of seeing the world. We have an easier time understanding this, and perceiving the complexities of a thing, when it's one that we're familiar with instead of one we're not.

If you're the kind of casual history nerd who's fascinated by Greco--Roman history, you might also like reading in more detail about the formation of the Mughal Empire, especially from Babur until Aurangzeb (the last great Mughal before the empire's decline). There are many themes in commons: uniting a vast land empire, layers of class conflict, struggle for power between brothers, military innovation and strategy, grand architecture that's still around to this day.
