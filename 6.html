Mark Robinson—often called Mark Keith Robinson because there's other people named Mark Robinson, some of whom will hopefully be more noteworthy than this one in the grand scheme of things—was elected to be the lieutenant governor of North Carolina in 2021. That's sort of like being the vice president, but of the state-level government. In 2023, he decided to run to be governor of the state in 2024. In November 2023, he lost (one of the few silver linings of the day).

In September 2024, on the 19th, [CNN reported they found his account](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum/index.html) on a pornographic website called Nude Africa from years earlier, where his identity was barely obscured at all. Here were some of the fun messages they spotlighted:

* "I came to a spot that was a dead end but had two big vent covers over it! It just so happened it overlooked the showers! **I sat there for about an hour and watched as several girls came in and showered**"
* "**I like watching tranny on girl porn!** That's fucking hot!"
* "I'm a black NAZI!"
* He refers to Martin Luther King Jr. as a "fucking commie bastard", and called him "worse than a maggot", and opposed a memorial to King in Washington, DC in 2011. The following year, Robinson wrote "I'd take Hitler over any of the shit that's in Washington right now!", in reference to that memorial.
* **"I'm not in the KKK. They don't let blacks join."**
* "Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it back. I would certainly buy a few."

The next day, on the 20th, [the Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/20/mark-robinson-mein-kampf-porn-posts) that on this pornographic website, Robinson "wrote extensively and in graphic detail about having extramarital sex with his wife's sister", and that "the same email Robinson used on the porn site was registered on Ashley Madison, a website used for extramarital affairs".

These revelations were so outrageous and generated so much attention that it led to almost his entire campaign staff quitting, [as local news reported a few days later](https://www.wunc.org/politics/2024-09-22/mark-robinson-campaign-staff-quit-cnn-report) ("... leaving Robinson with just three people working on his campaign — two campaign spokesmen and a bodyguard").

Mark Robinson is no stranger to making controversial statements in public these days, so it's not shocking that he said such outrageous things online in the past. Let's review some things that voters already had access to before the CNN reporters finding his porn accounts:

* "this foolishness about Hitler disarming MILLIONS of Jews and then marching them off to concentration camps is a bunch of hogwash" (2023)
* In July 2024, before the CNN report about his porn accounts, [Robinson gave a long, impassioned speech, rich with violent language](https://www.facebook.com/100068843461358/videos/june-30-2024-god-and-country-sunday/482087167688947/), anger about immigrants, vague references to a class of people within America who want to destroy the country from within to take your freedom.
 He stresses the importance of killing your opposition, and references bringing in the cops and the military. He *does* also mention fighting enemies in the context of World War II—but the only purpose of that comparison is so he can insinuate that violence against an unnamed 'domestic enemy' is equally justified as violence against Nazis.
 [Here's a transcript of that part, if you don't want to listen through that Facebook video.](mark-keith-robinson-2024-06-30-transcript.html)
* [referring to abortion] "It's about killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down" (his state-level opposition ran attack ads against him based on this statement)
* "I'm going to explain climate change to you. It's real simple, here it is: four times a year, the climate changes. ... It's that simple. End of less. ... This idiot [referring to Joe Biden] is over here **worried about climate change**, a science that is, I'm going to say it plain, **junk science**. I said it once and I'm gonna say it again, it's junk. It's **godless junk**." (2021)
* "There's **no reason anybody** anywhere in America **should be telling any child** about transgenderism, homosexuality, **any of that filth**." (2021)
* "Homosexuality is STILL an abominable sin and **I WILL NOT join in 'celebrating gay pride**.'" (2016, immediately after [the Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_nightclub_shooting) that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub)
* He said the Marvel film *Black Panther* (2018) was created by Jews and satanic Marxists to "pull the shekels out of your Schvartze pockets" (*Schvartze* is a Yiddish slur for black people; his intended meaning is to imply that Jewish people are just exploiting the black population)
* "Everything that god made, from the foul odour of what the cow left behind, to the decaying body of every living creature, to the maggots that eat those dead bodies, to the flies that will fly around what the cow left behind. God made all those things for a purpose. Will somebody please explain to me the purpose of homosexuality?" (2021)

A number of these statements he made during a speech at this church, which was reported on, and [the full recording is still online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7fvQ-zo9FY). Some other statements (like his Holocaust denial) were made on his public Facebook while in office and are still up. None of this was a secret from voters.

Nonetheless, this person not only got the party nomination to run to be governor, but it seems like he could have easily won despite what a terrible person he was—had it not been for that CNN report and the headlines calling him a 'black Nazi' who watches trans porn and wants to spy on girls in public showers or something. The Republican Party did well in North Carolina that election cycle, so it does make it seem like it was just this wave of controversy shortly before the election that screwed him over. All of his other horrific public statements wouldn't have been enough.

Robinson, for his part, denies everything and [now trying to sue CNN for 50 million dollars](https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-robinson-porn-posts-e195d3d8a03ce7d0b3496ab7cecefbe7).
