# The order of information |2024-12-03

Let's think about two different reviews of the same restaurant:

||indent
**A:** This restaurant is good, but it's expensive.
**B:** This restaurant is expensive, but it's good.

Maybe the word 'but' is biasing us---let's try that again.

||indent
**A:** This restaurant is good. It's also expensive.
**B:** This restaurant is expensive. It's also good.

No, wait, maybe 'also' is bad too?

||indent
**A:** This restaurant is good. This restaurant is expensive.
**B:** This restaurant is expensive. This restaurant is good.

Regardless of which conjunction you use, including no conjunction at all, if I say (positive thing) and then (negative thing), the result is you interpret the negative thing as being more important, or outweighing the positive thing.

Try it with anything else. "The writing is good, but the movie is slow-paced" is a negative review; "the movie is slow-paced, but the writing is good" is a positive review.

Think about this in your writing, and speaking. It's why that funny-sounding technique you've heard of called the 'compliment sandwich' actually works. If we leave on a bad note, then we leave with a bad impression. If we leave on a good note, then we leave with a good impression. The order of information matters.

A less-obvious implication of this: anticipating counter-examples, or naming them preÃ«mptively, seems to rhetorically nullify them. This is important because the truth of a generalization is difficult to quickly evaluate. Let's say I make the claim that birds can't fly. A person says "oh really, what about penguins?" Okay, you got me, there are some exceptions. They continue: "And ostriches. And have you ever heard of kiwis? Come on, do you even know what you're talking about? How ridiculous, to say birds can't fly."

If somebody were listening to our conversation and didn't already know there are thousands of bird species all over the world and the vast majority of them can fly, it might sound like I just made a stupid, wrong point and was quickly refuted with counter-examples.

But if I got out ahead of that by saying "There are some exceptions, like penguins or kiwis, but birds generally can't fly", then suddenly I'm immune to you pointing out counter-examples. If you said "but penguins are birds that can't fly", I could just say "um, yeah? I just said that" or "I already acknowledged there are some exceptions". Rhetorically, I win.

Pointing out a counter-example only rhetorically 'works' because by doing so you make it sound like the speaker was unaware of it prior. That or they were trying to obscure it from the audience. By acknowledging it ahead of time, you rob them of both implications. If I already know and acknowledge that penguins can't fly, then obviously penguins not being able to fly must not be able to subtract from the generalization I say afterwards.

But now think about how muddy this could get if the topic wasn't something obvious and based in common knowledge. Do you know what countries produce how many apples? It's not difficult info to quickly look up, but unless you happen to work in the produce industry or something, it's not something most people would just randomly have in their head. So if I said "Canada is one of the leading apple producers, it grows more than almost any other country", that might sound wrong at a glance---like, wait, even more than the US? Really?

But now imagine if I said: "Though some countries, like the US, produce even more, Canada is still one of the top apple producers in the world". That suddenly sounds a lot more credible. I'm acknowledging there are exceptions, and I'm demonstrating some knowledge about the topic, being aware of the exceptions, and baking that into my claim. The number of people who would bother challenging a claim like that on the fly is very small---even though it's still completely wrong, and Canada is by no means a top apple producer.

(Canada is something like 30th in the world for apple production. France grows 5x more and they're 9th. The US grows 13x more. China produces over 100x more. If there were some kind of world apple producer forum, Canada definitely wouldn't be a major player. But who just randomly know this?)

Now imagine how this could apply to more complex topics that nobody knows anything about and which are difficult to quickly verify or even understand---like technology, or politics, law, the economy, or war. A person could say "this country's military has been good, outside of a few exceptions where they did bad things", or "the main reason this event happened in history is because of the pressure applied by this movement during these years".

I recently wrote a post about Canada where I listed 12 reasons I like Canada more than the US, and in one part touched on our political leadership, overall giving Justin Trudeau a positive-sounding review. I note that he's had some problems and scandals, but acted appropriately in response to investigation and has overall, despite those scandals, been a good guy, especially compared with leadership in other countries. What if *I'm* bullshitting you, and Trudeau is actually corrupt as hell, and the few scandals I mention are just the tip of the iceberg? I could just be acknowledging some of his faults as a way of implying that I'm aware of the rare exceptions---like somebody saying "most birds are flightless, even though there are some exceptions, like pigeons and sparrows". How would you know?

Most of us know very little about most topics. We implicitly put a lot of trust in the person who's writing the stuff we read, because at every turn, they could be misleading it. But I guess that's as mundane as pointing out that every time you drive a car, you're putting a bunch of trust in other drivers to not randomly veer into you and kill you both. But in both cases, thinking about this and being aware of all the risk at play is probably useful.

This post is actually just an excuse to eventually pivot into talking about flightless birds, so let's get to that: a fun fact about 'flightless bird' species is that most people only know like four (penguin, emu, ostrich, kiwi), but there's technically 60 to 70 species of flightless bird---though that's more than it sounds because there's 18 species of penguins, 5 species of kiwi, and a few different ostriches and emus, meaning those 4 you already knew is at least a quarter of it, sort of. The rest are even harder to find, only on small islands you've never heard of and which were discovered more recently in history than the main four.

I love the 'Inaccessible Island rail', the smallest flightless bird, found on an archipelago called Tristan da Cunha in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. Why is that what they named it? Because it's a rail, and the island it's found on was literally called Inaccessible Island, as stupid as that sounds. I think it's great. Here, have some pictures.
