# The appearance of intelligence |2025-01-18

It's practically impossible for people of an average skill at a given thing to discern between somebody who's great and somebody who's *extremely* great. It's like how if I put my hands in boiling water, I couldn't really tell the difference between 150 degrees and 180 degrees. They're both just "extremely fucking hot". Nuance is lost in the extremes.

To visualize this, imagine graphing the entire population by how good they are at something (this could be any random skill---tennis, math, chess, guitar etc.). If you're at the peak of normality, where most people are, what I'm claiming is you probably can't tell the difference between two people who are way over to the right of you, even if one is meaningfully better than the other. To you, they're both just *really really good*. To tell them apart requires a lot of knowledge and appreciation for the skill, which you, as a normal person, probably don't have.

This also happens with general knowledge and intelligence. If you're in a town full of uneducated peasants who don't know anything about anything, they can't tell the difference between your average high school education and you being a world-renowned expert. Likewise on the internet, you don't need to be a credentialed academic to dazzle your way through arguments with people who know nothing. You just need to know more than average, and then you pummel them with your confidence and rhetoric.

I've become very good at spotting people who are overplaying their hand in this way, even about topics where I know very little. I can tell what genuinely educated people sound like, and what people who are exaggerating their knowledge sound like. I think to myself, "I don't know much about physics, but I don't trust that this person does either".

I sometimes end up talking to somebody like this, but about a topic where I actually am quite knowledgeable. A common example is young leftists who defend Marxism, but who barely know anything about Marxism when you get down to it. They're just used to yelling at right-wingers who know even less than they do, and rhetorically winning by referencing some of the basics and telling them to read a book.

And over time, people like that become unduly confident because they grow so accustomed to 'winning'. They haven't been humbled by an *actual* depth of knowledge, so discussion is less a productive activity and more a game they're trying to win. Being *seen* as the winner becomes a status symbol they don't want to lose, and they imagine the way they lose it is by being proved wrong about something, or having to admit or concede a point to their enemy. As a result, when they finally run into somebody they can't beat, it can be very deflating. They'll often double down and embarrass theirselves further simply because they don't know how else to react.

### Confidence

We all tend to assume that more confident answers are more likely to be correct. If you ask your neighbours what kind of tool you need to fix something in your house, and Tom says "uhh, I think it's tool X?" while Brad says "oh, it's definitely tool Y", Brad's confidence makes us likely to go with his answer instead. He sounds more like he knows what he's talking about, like he's more familiar with this type of problem, like he's more knowledgeable of the situation, etc.

This is easily abused. The term 'con man' refers to someone who tries you gain your confidence, not somebody who's confident---but con men are also often confident, and exuding confidence is a part of many scams. Just sound like you belong, sound like you know what you're talking about, sound like you're part of a legitimate organization, and who knows what people will let you talk them into.

In discourse, especially online, some people gradually become what I call **confidence ramblers**. They prefer talking about a topic that most people don't know much about, which means they're free to talk, and talk, and talk, because they feel safe they'll never get called out and challenged. Then the game just becomes target selection: avoid getting into arguments with anyone who might know more than you.

Common topics:

* History. Most people don't know that much about history outside of the few areas we're forced to study in school, so if you just read a few Wikipedia pages, you can sound like a scholar.
* Your country (if you're not American). Are you from Norway? Japan? Turkey? Just go find an American audience and ramble about the politics of your country. They won't know shit, so you can get away with playing really fast and loose with the facts. You're automatically the expert in the room, because it's *your* country, right?
* Any niche technical field where some people distrust the experts, and as such going against the clear 'consensus' might not instantly disqualify you. This gives you room to have your own opinions, and because you're more knowledgeable than the average person, you sound like you're credible enough to disagree with experts on reasonable grounds. **This happened a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic**---suddenly a lot of people became armchair epidemiologists. It also happens a lot with economics.

This is related to the knowledge--confidence misalignment that people call 'Mount Stupid'. I'm not sure who originated the term, but I feel like it was at least popularized by the web comic [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-12-28) back in the day. If we graph out how confident people are as they become more knowledgeable about a topic, ideally we'd expect it to be a linear relation (a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right)---but instead there's often a hump in the middle making it into the shape of a tilde, because people start to *feel* knowledgeable before they realize just how much there is to the topic.

The innocent explanation is that people don't realize they're on Mt. Stupid. They think they're on the right side of the left-side graph. Their knowledge increased, so they increased their confidence, and they just didn't realize how far to the right the graph goes. Then, as they learn more (if they do), they start to realize "oh shit, I didn't know as much about this as I think I do", and that realization humbles them for a while, which is why it dips back down.

On some level, though, confidence ramblers do know they're on Mt. Stupid. They know they're not really as knowledgeable as they're pretending to be. They know it's just for show. They have a point to make, they have a product to sell, an ad to push, some ideological point to confirm back to their audience. They avoid ever talking to or consulting with experts, because they don't want to burst their own bubble and betray how much their own confidence has been used as a supplement for genuine knowledge.

### Known unknowns

The Mt. Stupid phenomenon could also be framed through the Rumsfeld-popularized language of "known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns". There are some things you realize you don't know, but sometimes you don't even realize how much there is you don't knows. And this is all reminiscent of Socrates talking about the importance of the awareness of your own ignorance, of realizing the extent or limitations of your knowledge. The distance from Mt. Stupid to that humble area to the right of it is when unknown unknowns become known unknowns: you become aware of how much you don't know.

The failure to recognize the extent of your own ignorance is similar, again, to the **Dunningâ€“Kruger effect** (that's an en dash, because it's named after a guy called Dunning and a guy called Kruger). They said the less people know about something, the more they'll comparatively overestimate their own performance, because they don't even realize how much they got wrong. Accusing people of the Dunning--Kruger effect sort of became an internet meme at some point because it's just a fancier way to call somebody stupid. *"You have the Dunning--Kruger effect", "No, you're a Dunning--Kruger!" "No, you!"*

If we graph the distance between how people score on a test and how well they *think* they score on a test (before they get their results back), the 'effect' is when the delta between those values increases the further left you go on the X axis, like this:

To estimate your own performance is itself something that requires knowledge, so the less knowledge you have, the less ability you have to accurately evaluate your performance. But the Dunning--Kruger effect is, more specifically, the observation that **people who are worse at estimating their own performance tended to *overestimate* their own abilities, not underestimate them**. Why would it trend either way? Why wouldn't ignorant people underestimate theirselves just as much? This tendency suggests a severity of ignorance where what you're lacking are unknown unknowns, rather than known unknowns. Which is a more nuanced way of expressing the simple version ("you're too stupid to realize how stupid you are", as opposed to somebody who understand a topic well enough to realize their answers are likely wrong).
