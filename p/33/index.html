# The standard relationship model

I'm going to model the modern standard romantic relationship (as opposed to relationship models in other time periods, or relationships that aren't romantic), which is henceforth what is meant below by "relationship" when not otherwise specified.

When two people like each other and become fixtures in one another's lives, they become friends and the relation between them is called friendship. In comparison with friendship, a relationship is an arrangement committed to indefinitely by both of two participants which entails three areas of change, which I call the standard relationship commitments. These are:

1. **emotional or psychological change:** high affection, attraction; high general awareness of the other person and how you affect them; high trust, openness, willingness to share your innermost thoughts, bare your soul to them; high importance is placed on their acceptance and approval
2. **physical change:** having sex; comfort with nudity, being seen naked, being naked around each other; comfort with physical closeness (touching, cuddling) with each other in a manner far beyond what's normal for friendship
3. **situational or life-arrangement changes:** cohabitation; building life plan together; aid each other through life's difficulties (their problems are your problems); financial entanglement, shared ownership of property, shared finances

Arguably, no specific aspect of this is essential. That is, a relationship without any *one* of the above would still be a relationship; these are only the most typical component parts. However, some parts may be more important than others to whether or not the relationship will survive and be healthy (in most cases a relationship couldn't survive without its participants having sex, for example).

The reason people *agree* to relationship commitments is they experience a **standard romantic love-affliction** (which is henceforth what is meant below by "love" if not otherwise specified), which creates an intense desire for another person (henceforth: your target) and creates a deep satisfaction or pleasure from your access to them. (Long ago, the main thing driving the formation of relationship commitments was a desire for financial or household stability for family rearing, but over time everything has been love-ified.)

The standard love-affliction isn't something you enter into voluntarily or by coice; it's something that happens *to you* whether you like it or not, much like other ailments. It's difficult to terminate if you no longer want to be in love with a person, which can result in social turmoil (typically ending a love-affliction requires total disconnect from your target for a significant length of time).

The experience of love is an obsessive desire, longing, or yearning for your target, but it's also characterized by various pain-threats associated with not getting what you want from them. This can be split into subtypes, which are similar in theme but feel slightly different and which therefore have associated language to differentiate them.

1. If you target doesn't love you back, this hurts (this is called **unrequited love**).
2. If your target does love you back, but for whatever reason you two can't have a relationship, that inability to actualize your feelings together hurts (we might call this **ill-fated love**, **love that cannot be**, or **forbidden love**, depending on the context).
3. If, after falling in love, you lose access to this person entirely (e.g. they move away, cut off contact with you, or die), this hurts (we call this **missing** or **emptiness**, and it's the route you likely need to go in order to end a love affliction that you don't want to continue).
4. If you form a relationship with your target, but they later share your intimacy with others (**cheating** or **infidelity**), this doesn't subtract from your access to them in quantity, but can reduce the uniqueness or distinction of your connection, or devalue what you two had together, similar to inflation devaluing your currency, and therefore hurts you (**envy**, **jealousy**, **betrayal**).

If you don't feel pain at the times that you're supposed to, this will be interpreted as evidence that you're not truly feeling love. In other words, if somebody is in love with you, then not having access to you *should* (is expected to) hurt them. If it doesn't hurt them, maybe that just shows you're not really that important to them, and their desire for you isn't true love.

Your target loving you back is a major source of *validation*. It's also the necessary justification for engaging in relationship commitments to begin with (otherwise, why bother?). It's seen as the 'spark' that makes doing all of this worthwhile. If a person found out their partner doesn't really love them back, it would be painful even if their partner still agreed to continue doing their relationship commitments anyway. We don't just want our partner to go through the motions of being in a relationship; we want them to truly feel it.

Throughout life, people tend to engage in far more unsuccessful relationships than successful ones. When a person falls in love, it's often random and leads to failure and pain more frequently than it will lead to happiness. And yet if given the choice, most people would prefer to remain susceptible to this condition than remove the possibility of it. We consider the potential benefit to be worth the risk and cost. It's a gamble that you know you'll lose 9 times out of 10, but that 10th time makes it all worth it (even though there's no guarantee you'll ever get your win, and you know some people just die alone).

If a person falls in love with a friend and can't translate those feelings into a relationship, the pain of having to be around them as "just friends" can be so painful they may find it intolerable; and to terminate that love, they need to disconnect from that person entirely. This is why many people try to avoid developing love for close friends, because there's a risk of "ruining the friendship".

Wandering through life while trying to seek the fulfilment of a relationship, falling in and out of love, being hurt by relationships that don't work out, is all a big part of the human experience and of human culture in general. There are many things all throughout our society meant to facilitate the seeking or pursuing of loving relationships, and many of our songs and stories feature seeking and pursuing love as their main theme or plot points.

Any space-alien visiting Earth for an extended stay who's interested in a more comprehensive human experience might want to try their hand at this fascinating ritual.
