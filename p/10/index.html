# Touchscreens and smartphones |2024-12-02

Did most people enjoy the trend of tech companies pushing us toward fewer and fewer physical controls, replacing everything with touchscreens? I feel like it was something we all made fun of, but it just carried on. Who asked for this? The engineers and designers at the companies who made our stuff, that's who. They unlock a new technology and they want to use it, so they put it everywhere and hope we like it. Now it's happening again with artificial intelligence. Suddenly every service I use thinks it has to weave the latest trendy feature into itself.

When it comes to physical controls, though, it seems like enough time has passed since the novelty that now [some companies are starting to roll back and give us more buttons and stuff again](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/touch-screens-are-over-even-apple-is-bringing-back-buttons-86fb9ea8). From cars and phones to small appliances, printers, coffee makers, mp3 players---why did people ever think having as few buttons as possible made things better? I guess the actual answer is it was new, which made it seem futuristic and cool. Was it?

In Star Trek, seemingly everything was controlled by shiny touchscreen panels with weird interfaces. Whenever we saw their screens, everything was oddly shaped, lots of colours, rounded edges. They were being imaginative, because that wasn't normal at the time, and it was fun because it was so different. What *could be*? But real talk, do we think engineers and pilots and soldiers in the year 2365 are going to want to launch torpedoes at the enemy ship, or accelerate their runabout, by *tapping a screen*? Come on.

Not only is having a touchscreen for everything *lame* if you think about it (not from our perspective as the audience going 'ooo, shiny', but from the perspective of starship personnel tapping screens to do everything), it's actually worse for practical reasons. Tactile controls give you intuitive, physical feedback that provides implicit information about the task you're doing. This would make no difference for a robot, but for humans, there's a lot of understanding smuggled in.

#### Consider:

* A joystick makes you feel the difference between going fast and slow because you're physically leaning into it, and you know when you're at max speed because you physically can't push the thing any further in that direction.
* A physical switch *feels* like choosing between two binary options, because there's resistance against you pressing it, until around the half-way point; then it forcibly flips itself to the other side, not letting you rest it in the middle.
* A knob tells you it controls a one-dimensional property, because there's only two 'directions' you can turn it, but also communicates that the property is highly continuous rather than discrete values---unless you it clicks into place along notches as you turn it, in which case you instantly understand you're dealing with discrete values. Many knobs also allow you to easily control the rate of change (in terms of change per degrees the knob rotates) by having the rate increase when you move the knob quickly.
* A button with more significant depth feels more important or impactful, conveying implicit info about the nature of the task, and the click you feel provides assurance that it's actually been pressed.

That's a general theme with tactile controls: you can feel you're actually using them correctly because something happens. This makes them easier to use without looking. You need to constantly look at touch screen controls to use them, because you can't feel where the buttons are otherwise, and you can't be sure it's even doing anything unless you look at what changes on-screen. In some way or another these traditional controls all provide very natural, intuitive ways of interacting with the task they're designed for, which tapping a piece of glass completely fails to replicate.

Long ago, if you wanted to send a text message with a cell phone, the way it worked was each number was associated with a few letters, and you'd cycle through the letters by pressing the number. If you wanted to say 'hello', you'd press 4433555 555666, because 'h' was the second letter on 4, 'e' was the second letter on 3, and so on. Sound fun? That's why everybody quickly tried to develop ways to communicate using as few letters as possible. Then cell phones got more advanced, because everybody was texting all the time and companies realized using a numpad fucking sucked, so you started getting phones with full keyboards. For that brief window in time, we had it made.

When the iPhone came out, I thought it was stupid because I didn't see any reason to want to use a touchscreen keyboard instead. For texting and making phone calls, the interface of the phone I had at the time seemed better. What's the point? I don't want to rub my finger on a piece of glass. It's been 17 years and I still fucking hate typing things on a touchscreen. It got slightly better over time, but it's still fundamentally bad and always will be.

The iPhone didn't instantly catch on and convert everybody. Adoption was slow because it was expensive and while there were many Apple fans who were hyped, there were also many people like me who didn't see the appeal. What I didn't see, and what many critics didn't see, was the incredible potential for these things to become extremely modular and for every company in the world to have a fully customizable app in your pocket, unlocking functionality my tactile keyboard couldn't dream of, and a huge market for the development of all these apps. So now smartphones are ubiquitous, almost all phones and smartphones, and we don't even say the 'smart' part anymore, they're just phones.

But what do I actually want to do with my phone? Very little. I mainly have it because I can't bring my computer with me everywhere, and because you need a phone number to verify you're a real person on a bunch of websites. A modern phone is just a tiny, worse computer, and I have a computer, so I'd rather just use that. What I find incredible and perplexing is how many people will sit at home, where their computers are, and choose to use their phones instead. Why? I guess it means they can wander around the house, but I'd rather be at my desk. It's more comfortable than having to crane your neck down to look at a thing you're holding in your hands. I only even touch my phone when I have to or if I'm going outside. And I don't even like bringing my phone with me when I go out. I don't like that it's the expected norm I have a communications device with me at all times. It's like the internet is stalking me, not letting me go anywhere without it. I'm just going for a walk, okay? I don't *need* my phone with me. Jeez.

If you asked me in 2017 to imagine what life in the future will be like, I'd have said a lot of things---but when it comes to design principles, I'd say my god, hopefully we eventually move on from putting touchscreens on everything. It doesn't feel futuristic to me. It feels stupid and tacky, and you end up limited in inputs anyway unless they put a keyboard onto the touchscreen, and then using a touchscreen keyboard is obviously terrible.

Do you know what *hasn't* aged poorly or gotten old, and what I can see enduring into the far future? Mouse and keyboard. And of course it would be, right? We need some way to 'point' at the thing on screen that we want, but having to literally raise our arm up to the screen and tap is too stupid and your arm gets tired, so having a little thingy on your desk that controls an on-screen pointer is just intuitive and simple and obvious and works perfectly. And then we need some way to make inputs, and having a big array of buttons is super versatile and functional. The mouse and keyboard setup is the wheel of computing. I really don't think we're going to reinvent it.

The only thing that *does* feel futuristic to me is voice control. I didn't like the concept at first, but it turns out what I actually don't like is computers talking back at us, whereas voice-to-text functions that try to transcribe what we're saying into text? That's fine with me, actually. And in recent years, this technology has become far more accurate. Now if I'm outside and want to send a text message, I always just press the voice-text button and talk at my phone. I try to actually use the keyboard as little as possible.

Star Trek didn't accurately predict how technology would develop. Almost no sci-fi did, obviously. But they did a good job at thinking about how real people would actually want to implement the technology that does get developed, by integrating it into human lives in a healthy way. I don't think most people want little bits of computer in their brain, for example. We don't want to turn everything fake and hyper-optimize every aspect of our being and become robotic producer-consumers. Nor should 'social media' be a thing, at least in the form it exists now, probably. I like to headcanon that humanity went through a phase like our present, realized that a lot of our current trends are bad for us, and the future we see in the show is the result of them having learned these lessons already.

For being a show about people hundreds of years from now roaming the galaxy and talking to aliens, Star Trek was very grounded in a sense. They outlawed human genetic engineering because they didn't want humanity to fundamentally lose its sense of self. They played instruments made with wood and string, even though there was nothing stopping them from just telling the computer to play any song they want. They ate food that resembled food you and I ate, even though they probably had the technology to just eat a magic pill that satisfies all their nutritional needs. Their way of life was balanced with human psychology, and they never lost track of that and sacrificed everything at the altar of technology.

In case you missed it, a few years ago there were some headlines about how scientists had developed 'liquid trees' by filling a tank with a bunch of goo and leaving it in an open area. The result would fulfil the same function as trees, but more *efficiently*, in some way or another. It was even green!

For all I know this could actually be a great invention, especially for heavily polluted cities in Asia where there's like a billion cars on the road---but it was divisive because it's fucking *weird*, and it was written about like the future we're going to not have trees anymore because instead we'll have the privilege of installing these buckets of slime all over the place instead. Would anybody want that? No, my god, I don't think I could want it any less.

It's like the "[lets make little mechanical bumblebees that pollinate flowers to compensate for the fact our industries are killing off the bee population](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/03/03/517785082/rise-of-the-robot-bees-tiny-drones-turned-into-artificial-pollinators)" thing all over again. Like, could we maybe do something to *not* kill off all the bees, instead of trying to replace them with robots? Trees aren't just oxygen purification machines. There's a great psychological value to nature beyond it being a means to an end. Nobody would be happy if we had to replace actual trees with some kind of artificial tree-replacement. This robotic, utility-oriented, efficiency-obsessed machine-cult technology-worship creeps everybody out.

That's kind of what I think about whenever I have to argue with people about whether gross domestic product (GDP) is the most important metric for a country. It's important because it measures economic force in an international context, not our quality of life. There are many ways in which we could improve our GDP, but at the cost of living worse lives, because economic indicators don't capture everything about the human experience. We can then reverse that understanding and say there are some ways in which we 'purchase' better lives, at the 'cost' of unrealized GDP gains. We could surely increase GDP from wherever it is now if we all stopped taking so much time off work and retired later, for a simple example.

I often think about an old episode of *The Simpsons* where an aptly named device called the Sun Blocker was installed above the city, casting the whole place in darkness. What if doing that increased GDP somehow? Would I have to explain to people that maybe the benefit of having sunshine---not only because of solar panels or saving money on lighting, but even the *psychological* benefits of it---might be preferable to the gains in productive output? What if our factories' gizmo production per material input ratio could be increased if we outlawed listening to music, killed all our pets, and underwent a surgery to remove taste buds from our tongues?
