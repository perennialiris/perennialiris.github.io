# Israel--Palestine notes | 2025-02-13

Israel--Palestine feels like the most polarizing issue ever. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. How could you not support the only democracy in the Middle East and side with the antisemitic terrorists who rape innocents and use their own people as human shields? No, wait, I mean---how could you possibly support the apartheid state that's trying to genocide Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out and having no opinion isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor. Silence is violence. No matter what you do or say, some portion of the population ends up hating you.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. It's strained some of mine. I'm willing to take that risk over certain issues, where if someone disagrees with me I'd prefer they know (and possibly fuck off). But this one is so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, and ultimately is not something directly relevant to my life, so it's usually not worth touching. It's safer to avoid the conversation. And I feel that's what most people did before the Hamas attack on 2023-Oct-07, which thrust the issue again into our view and made having a strong opinion about it most fasionable. Since then popular sentiment has shifted against Israel, and Palestine flags have started showing up seemingly everywhere.

In my own view, I'm reasonably critical of Israel, but in some other people's view I'm not critical *enough* and may therefore be condemned as their defender. To be sure, there's aspects of Israeli politics I find concerning---then again, there's aspects of most country's politics we find concerning. But my feeling, before the Oct-7 attacks, was that we should probably be making our support for Israel more conditional, making some demands of them, drawing some red lines about what we're comfortable with them doing if they want to stay in our good graces and have our stamp of approval. Their slow expansion into the West Bank seems plainly unjustified, their occupation of the Golan Heights should probably end, and I wouldn't approve of them expanding into Gaza should that happen in the future. In the worst light Israel appears similar to Russia, i.e. a country that's annexing territory simply because it can. They also have politicians who talk about the surrounding territory in historical, Biblical terms, as though they have some kind of right to a greater territory because god promised it to them, which isn't a reasonable perspective that I'd want to be part of any government. Then the Oct-7 attacks happen, and the situation gets tricky. What can Israel do in response? What is it reasonable for them to do?

The position I find myself in is being surrounded by people who are critical of Israel in a way that to me seems one-sided and unreasonable, and for many of whom this one issue has become a pipeline to general left-wing extremism (though they often don't seem to recognize it as such). They operate as black-and-white thinkers (you either want to destroy all of Israel because it has no right to exist, otherwise you're okay with everything Israel is doing and think they can do no wrong) who are incredibly biased against Isreal in every situation (everything Israel does is viewed through the most critical lens possible, Israelis are afforded no empathy or understanding---meanwhile groups like Hamas are given endless compassion and excuses, no matter how heinous their actions), who play fast and loose with all the details (timelines, numbers, reliability of reporting), who are very attached to and insist only on their own language and framing (e.g. genocide, apartheid state, ethnic cleansing---you're not allowed to disagree with their use of any of these labels, or the conversation ends there). It has made reasonable discourse challenging.

Throughout the rest of this page, I'm going to compile my thoughts on every aspect of the conflict I can think of.

### Why is this conflict so important?

It's not callous to pick and choose what things get your attention. There is nobody who talks about every single conflict going on in the world; there are too many of them, each with their own history and complexities. How much attention do any of us pay to the deadly civil wars happening right now in Myanmar and Yemen, or the drug wars happening between rival gangs in South America, or the thousands of people who've died recently in West Africa between splinters of ISIS and al-Qaeda? Not only do most people not care about any of these conflicts, they generally aren't even *aware* of them. The Russia--Ukraine war is the most important thing happening right now, both in number of casualties and geopolitical implications, and it feels closer to home than many of these other conflicts. It makes sense people talk about that one. But Israel--Palestine? Why is this one front and centre for so many people? If a person's family is from Israel or the Middle East, that's more understandable, but what explanation is there for all the young white people who end up so invested?

We're intrigued by the connection between early Zionism and European history. We learn in school about Jews being victims of the Holocaust. Zionism, which already existed in Europe as a Jewish independence movement, grew in response, and Israel was created in the aftermath. In some sense it is our doing, for better or for worse. If there were a causal link between things that happened here in the West and, say, the war in Myanmar, then we should be more likely to pay attention to it. In a similar vein, politicians in the West talk about Israel and get up on stage and clarify their support for it, calling it our ally, mentioning it in their party platforms. If every election season, our political class pledged their support for Andorra, it might make you curious about what the hell is going on over there---because like, wait, what are we supporting exactly? Then if you found out Andorra does a bunch of bad stuff, you might be upset to find out we're all expected to support them.

The conflict also offers enough depth, with so many 'moving parts', that we can talk about it all day if we so choose. We end up talking about the local history, our feelings about imperialisn and colonialism, the ethnics of warfare and armed conflict, international law, terrorism and propaganda. We may even discuss fundamental questions about what is a nation or people. The topic has always been in our view for so long (most other conflicts are very short-lived by comparison) that people have grown attached to one narrative or the other, and the longer they're so attached the more information they process through that lens, digging them in further.

In the last few years, the conflict has been packaged in a way that's made people begin to feel it's morally uncomplicated. Which is ironic, because of its complex history in which both sides have done wrong, the ambiguity and nuance of the moral questions the issue forces us to address, and how infamously intractable the conflict has seemed for so long. For most of my life, "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline, a simile for a messy situation that's impossible to figure out. But as the issue has come into the spotlight again and again, oversimplified and one-sided anti-Israel rhetoric has convinced a growing crowd of people that figuring out who's in the right is actually a very simple matter: just say "Israel is doing genocide, and genocide is bad". If anyone disagrees, you say, like, what are you, a genocide defender?

The pro-Israel people have a similar thing, but about terrorism. What are you, a terrorist defender? Don't you know that Hamas uses their people as human shields and wants to kill every Jewish person? Is that really the side you choose to stand with? Both sides think they have a clear moral high-ground. In that push-and-pull in the court of public opinion ("my side has the moral high-ground", "no, my side does!", "no, mine!"), Israel has been slowly losing. Their case is less persuasive, less appealing. And that's probably mostly because they're more powerful, wealthier, and better equipped than their opponents. And because they're seen as the colonizers, due to the history of how the country was created.

## Competing intuitions

Imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine. You've never heard about it before, you have no bias, you haven't been influenced to think one way or another. If you started examining the conflict right now, or perhaps at a point in time 3 years ago, what would be your initial impression?

It depends. The conflict invites different intuitions depending on who's asking and what direction your mind happens to go. Here are some possibilities:

#### 1. Choose the side that does less bad stuff.

This is how many people who end up being more pro-Israel operate. If there's a war between two sides and we have to choose which to support, a good way to start is to ask which side is less immoral. There are many ways in which Israel comes across as less bad than groups like Hamas or Hezbollah. They have a better system of government, better laws. They're better on women's rights, gay rights, religious tolerance. Until 2014 they were the only country in the region where homosexuality wasn't illegal. They also commit many fewer atrocities and war crimes. If a normal person looks at Tel Aviv and then at cities in other countries in the region, they might pretty quickly decide what side they want to be on.

#### 2. Choose the side that aligns with us.

If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and saying they're willing to work with us, then maybe we should just pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is, apparently, a good ally to the United States. They do good intelligence work, they have a good tech industry. They provide us a good foothold in the Middle East. Prior to trying to examine the conflict itself, a person might just decide supporting Israel seems like the rational choice.

#### 3. With great power comes great responsibility, or, a tendency to favour the underdog.

If one side of a conflict is far more powerful and wealthy than the other, they're the ones who are really in control and they should ergo be held to a higher standard, and we should be examining the conflict primarily from their perspective. They're holding all the cards. We should also be careful about how much blame we put on people who are oppressed, because they have fewer options, be more desperate, and in cases where an unfair situation goes on for more than a generation, you'll have people being born into this conflict who know no other life, so they lack our modern perspective to guide their own actions. They have agency, but perhaps less culpability.

#### 4. Anti-imperialism---or, bias for the native population.

This is more common among the far-left than moderates, but some people look at the conflict and they see Israel as the more foreign country whose population are outsiders to the region, whereas the Palestinians are the people who were there first. This means even before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same land, there is more legitimacy to the Palestinian claim, and ergo Palestinians are more justified in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as part of or an extension of a broader Western colonial project, which further casts it in a negative light. There is a lingering feeling of injustice that comes from the feeling that Israel is itself built on stolen property.

(The less-obvious problem with this view is that the view Israelis are foreigners to the region is factually inaccurate and generally considered to be anti-Israel propaganda, framing the Jewish people as being European or American transplants. From the beginning, there have always been many Israelis of Middle Eastern descent, and today the majority of Jewish people in Israel were born in Israel.)

#### 5. Anti-Americanism---or, Anti-Western bias.

This is similar to the previous point, and again a far-left tendency, especially for people who are coming from within the American sphere of influence. They criticize everything through the lens of not wanting America to go around imposing its influence onto the rest of the world, and will therefore tend to view conflicts through the lens of that which does and doesn't support American interests. Israel can be viewed as an extension of American interests, if not a puppet state of the US, a wedge the US is using to divide or destabilize the Middle East for its own purposes. Israel, they reason, should therefore be opposed.

#### 6. Be sensitive to our own prejudice.

We all have some bias or another, and some---racism, sexism, xenophobia---can affect how people judge a conflict between parties of different groups. Liberal people try to be aware of common prejudice and compensate for them in our evaluation of things. Not all prejudice is conscious and deliberate, but combatting prejudice generally has to be. If a fight happens at work between a man and woman in a way that seems to make others bias toward the man, we might stop and give extra consideration to the woman's point of view to ensure we're not overlooking her perspective out of sexism (even if a passive, 'accidental' sexism). Would we feel the same way about what happened if their roles were reversed but their actions weren't? If so, why? This kind of self-checking and reflection can be valuable.

If you apply this to Israel--Palestine, there are some ways in which there's a danger of being biased toward Israel: Israeli is more similar to our society, they're more 'Western', many Americans are prejudiced against Muslims, we also tend to like wealthier people over poorer people, and Israelis are generally thought of or depicted as being more racially 'white' than the Arabs (this isn't really true---many Israelis are 'non-white'---but it's still part of how many people conceptualize the conflict). So automatically, we should place a higher level of scrutiny on the Israelis, to compensate for the ways in which we might just be being prejudiced against the other side.

#### 7. Anti-Jewish bias.

An unfortunate reality Jewish people face is being the perpetual victims of conspiracy theories. In the West, this has been present in people's views of Israel for decades---from speculation about the USS *Liberty* (a US Navy ship that was attacked by Israel in error during the 60s), to the notion that Israel somehow caused or had something to do with the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, to the idea that Israel is to this day somehow calling the shots of American foreign policy through legitimate advocacy work by organizations like AIPAC. In the United States, a non-zero portion of people oppose doing anything to support Israel because they view Israel not as an ally that can help serve US interests, but instead as a bunch of sneaky Jews who are somehow working to manipulate or undermine US interests.

Which way of thinking do you find most appealing?

---

By this point, I feel that I've given consideration to many different angles and arguments surrounding this conflict. When I walked into it for the first time, it struck me how many different angles a person could intuitively take to. But being honest, the two intuitions from the above that most affected me were **choosing the side that's less bad** (which leads me to favour Israel) and **being sensitive to our own prejudice** (which made me feel cautious about condemning the Palestinians without being fair to their side and their perspective).

Here's some observations I made with respect to the first bias:

* The Arab factions Israel are at war with are virtually fascists, or what some people call Islamofascism. They want to holocaust the Jews in Israel and create a totalitarian society in its place, substituting Nazi race ideology for militant Islamic fundamentalism. They also have virtually no ethics, no respect for international law, and, of course, would like to oppress women and homosexuals even worse than other Muslim countries do.
* Israel is governed more in line with a middling European democracy. They let people vocally criticize them, form opposition parties, and vote the ruling party out of power if they choose. Their military is also held to far higher standard than any other power in the region.
* Hamas and similar groups want to exterminate every Jew from Israel. Israel does not have similar goals or desires. The Zionist talking point that "if Hamas put down their weapons, there would be peace; if every Israeli put down their weapons, there would be a second holocaust" seems basically accurate.

That seemed to form a reasonable basis for leaning toward Israel. However, I also had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort to brutality *after decades of injustice* make right the initial injustice? How should I expect a population to react if they were invaded, occupied, displaced?

### Terrorism isn't unique to any population

If the region where I live were annexed by some other country and we were occupied---or ruled over by a neighbouring state that freely entered our territory at will in a manner that was very close to if not technically an occupation---for a long period of time, and all of us opposed this and wanted it to stop but couldn't overpower this enemy through conventional means and they were unwilling to cede control to us, then my expectation is that my people would eventually become terrorists, for lack of better word. Some of them, anyway. Not all of us, not a majority, but some of us. Enough of us that it would pose a problem.

I'm not describing this as good or bad. The point is only to say that in any large population, there will be a diverse range of psychologies, including people who are more willing than average to engage in what I consider terrible actions, especially when they feel their cause is righteous and desperate. On a similar note: in Nazi Germany, who do you think guarded all the extermination camps? They didn't have to breed those Germans in a lab. They already existed among the population. If a dictatorship arose in any given country, there's going to be some percentage of people who come to support it. And if your country *doesn't* fall to dictatorship, those people would probably just carry on living normal lives, their potential for horrific action never being realized or utilized. They exist among us. Their psychotic nature requires a certain environment to activate it. I sometimes encounter people whom I think this about: "If we lived in Nazi Germany, this guy would've been fine standing guard at Dachau." Haven't you ever met anyone like that? Not that they're going to become a serial killer in this life, but that if the stars aligned and he was called to action, he'd shrug and pull the trigger.

This is all just to say I feel it's important, as part of our perspective in judging another population, to remember that our potential to do horrific things to one another has not disappeared from the gene pool. We've managed to create peaceful, orderly societies, but we're not inherently special or better in that way. If our societies collapsed, some of us would eventually be terrorists too. There are people in Gaza today who were born there while it was occupied by Israel, and then people who were born after Israel stopped occupying it directly, but while it's still under blockade with a militarized border and periodic excursions into their territory by Israeli militants. In the West Bank, people are born into a circumstance where they're relatively poor and unsafe, but soldiers from that more powerful country to the west of them occasionally come in and act like they run the place. We can only imagine what this feels like. And this is the only world they've ever known.

Then down the street from them, there's a man who identifies the source of all their problems, and offers them a chance to join the fight. Of course many of them are interested. There's a chance that you'd have been too, in their shoes. The young people in these places have been being propagandized and radicalized into committing their life to fighting against Israel very early on, and there's not exactly ethics classes in their schools teaching them about how great it is to follow international law instead.

Are these conditions Israel's fault? If they are, then despite my first intuitions about the matter being to side with Israel on the grounds they operate more morally today, Israel's moral superiority can't be the end of the story.

Let's imagine there's a slave society. They have laws and a rigid code of ethics, but that includes slavery being okay and some people being owned as property. Suppose there were slaves who broke free and rebelled, and in so doing did what appeared at a glance as morally heinous actions. They kill innocent women and children, whole families of civilians who were not to blame for their conditions. Let's say they raped the women, too. Would it be sufficient for me to look at this and say the slaves are acting more immorally than the slavers, and therefore siding with the slavers? In this, I'm really just judging which person I'd feel safer having tea with. It doesn't speak to the question of whether the conditions of slavery are justified to begin with. Critically, it leaves open whether the morally heinous actions of some rebel are truly worse than the systemic enforcement of slavery in the first place. Sometimes, immoral things can appear more moral simply because they're part of a system that legitimizes itself through rules and procedure. But what if the system is evil?

This is where some people don't agree when I say Hamas does more immoral things than Israel. They view Israel's very existence, or the existence of the blockade, or Israel's military occupation in the West Bank, to be evil (which thing they focus on depends in the person). Hamas is like the rebel slave, reacting to Israeli oppression. The observation that Hamas does wicked things as part of their fight doesn't speak to whether Israel's actions are justified to begin with. This is why you can't avoid getting into the history of everything.

Be careful not to fall too hard in the other direction either, though. Just because you're a victim doesn't mean you can't also be a villain. Maybe that guy who beats his wife was bullied as a child. Everybody has a story for why they are the way they are. We can't act like people have no responsibility for their actions just because something bad happened to them. The Nazis had a story of how they had been pushed around and beaten on, too. Feeling like you're the underdog and ergo you have license to break the rules and pursue vengeance can be a powerful tool in service of evil.

How did we get here? First, I want to ask: how did it come to be that a majority of people in the West support Israel, anyway? Let's consider the early Israeli narrative, and the history that led up to Israel's founding.

### Israel has a compelling, heroic narrative

If you're critical of Israel, this is worth trying to understand. Why do so many people support Israel? This appeal has faded over time, but it's something you should be able to acknowledge. Israel has, at least on paper, a compelling, heroic national story. It's not a story that is told as often as it used to be, though. Despite the conspiracy theories, Israel has not been great at propagating its perspective and narrative to a Western audience. (Terror groups like Hamas by contrast have been very effective at this.)

The Jews were effectively a powerless, persecuted minority, constantly scapegoated and discriminated against, and now they were the primary targets of one of the most terrible genocides of all time. And even after having just liberated them from the Nazis, many of the most powerful Western countries didn't care about the Jews. Jewish refugees were turned away, rejected, and continued to be treated badly. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. How could they? So they came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance, to create their own space where they could be safe and have autonomy instead of being forever at the mercy of the ruling majority population of other countries. Predictably they were attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who would prefer to wipe them all out.

20-5.png|Israel, surrounded in the Middle East

Today the 'underdog' mentality benefits the Palestinians, but in the past it more benefited Israel. Look at them on a map, surrounded by much larger enemies who are more numerous in number. And Israel didn't used to have the technological or economic advantages it has today. For decades Israel was the underdog in the Middle East, and much of that time was spent during the Cold War, when the entire world was fighting over democracy versus Communism. They were on our side, the only democracy in the Middle East. Their victories felt like our victories. That's how people alive today who remember those years largely feel about it. They went to war against Hezbollah and Hamas, they came out ahead, then we took down the Berlin Wall, and it all blurs together in the collective memory as a time that it kicked ass to be American.

Then 9/11 happened. The public was psychologically unprepared for the trauma this would apparently inflict upon them. This firmly secured that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, the Muslims are the ones who aren't on our side, meaning the Jews are the ones who are, because the enemy of my enemy and all that. But if you were born in the late 90s or later, you might barely remember 9/11, not remember the Cold War at all, and none of this really means anything to you. For you, Israel is just some country somewhere that all your politicians weirdly feel the need to mention, and then you hear on the news that they're doing apartheid and racism and ethnic cleansing, and you're like, hey, wait, isn't this terrible? There's a significant generational difference in information and perspective.

Israelis view theirselves as being surrounded by big enemies, and having a history of fighting big enemies. They think they're the little guy. But when people in the West today look at Israel, they only compare Israel to Palestine. They look at Israeli soliders, then they look at where people in Gaza live. The frame has shifted in such a way that Israel is now viewed as the oppressor bullying the little guy. This shift happened partly because of deliberate media tactics by Israel's critics, but also due to actually changing circumstances. Which framing is more accurate?

To get a feel for things like that, we have to back at least a century or so.

## The history of the conflict

I'm not an historian. I haven't spent years thoroughly researching this. I'm going to end up glossing over some things. If you think I'm missing something important, not giving certain things enough focus, or that I'm misunderstanding or mischaracterizing certain events, then I'm open to talk about that. I'm just doing my best to try and understand the basic timeline of events that led to where we are today, and I'm going to share the understanding that I've come away with.

Even before the rise of Nazi Germany, Jews were not treated well in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904) is considered to have been the Jew who founded modern Zionism by talking about how Jews should all come together and make a country. The case that Jews ought to do this---because they can't trust the Christian countries of Europe to treat them well---would only get stronger over time, and these ideas became all the more potent after his death.

20-1.png|The Ottoman Empire in 1914

As a consequence of the events of World War I (1914--1918), the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled most of the Middle East, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides, and Britain helped support an unsuccessful Arab revolt against the Ottomans in 1916. The following year, with WWI still ongoing, British foreign secretary Balfour declared that Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in the Ottoman region of Palestine, where there was already a small Jewish population. His letter of support is now known as **Balfour declaration**.

However, Britain also made conflicting agreements with Arab leaders, who were taking great risk in revolting against the Ottomans, and the British agreed to recognize Arab independence after the war in exchange for their participation. This traces back to a series of communications in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahon–Hussein correspondence**. 'Hussein' refers to Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi, 1854--1931, the Sharif of Mecca who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. He detested the Balfour declaration and refused to work with the British after the war, more independent now as the King of Hejaz, a new country ruling over the western strip of the Arabian peninsula that used to be Ottoman territory. This led the British to support Ibn Saud, who conquered Hejaz and took Mecca, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia.

A civil war meanwhile took place in Turkey while Allied forces occupied Constantinople, leading to a victory by Atatürk and the formation of the modern Turkish republic. I mention this to further emphasize that at this point in time, there was a lot of change happening in the world. Countries were rising and falling, borders were changing, and millions of people were migrating in great number.

After the war, the Levant ended up being controlled by the British and French, who had agreed ahead of time, back in 1916, to partition the area horizontally, with Britain taking the southern part and France the north. This was called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement**. Palestine, then known as Mandatory Palestine, was the region on the western-most part of the British side of the partition, ergo it was the British whom the Jews had to work with to control the area. This was a year *before* the Balfour declaration.

There was then a lull. Jewish people started immigrating into the region, settling new towns, developing farmland, and causing conflict with the Arab population. The British at some point limited how many Jews were allowed to immigrate to the region because they noticed it was causing conflict. Though Jewish people had always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to these Jews was exacerbated, at the time, by the perception they were Europeans rather than Middle Easterners, an argument still implicitly made to this day, though it no longer applies.

20-2.png|A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region, not carelessly in half but with some respect to the existing demography and sociological boundaries. They wanted to allow Jews to have a majority in the region allotted to them so they could be an independent community rather than be ruled by a Muslim majority, per the wishes of the whole movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would have ended up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' side would only have remained majority Jewish by a few percentage points. In other words, they put as many Muslims as possible into the Jewish community without going over, then gave the rest of the land to the Muslims as well.

Despite this, Muslims viewed the partition plan as favouring the Jews, boycotted participation in the negotiations, and refused to accept any partition plan that was proposed. A civil war then broke out, the UN plan was never implemented, and the result was an Israeli victory. Israeli forces, having been attacked for trying to accept an international partition plan that would cede half the territory they originally aspired for, forced hundreds of thousands of Arabs out of the region. In Israel, this was seen as a completion of Israel's war of independence, an assertion of Israeli sovereignty, and an unavoidable reality in the face of people who wanted to dominate and exterminate them. For Palestinians, this became known as **the Nakba**, an act of ethnic cleansing and dispossession that gave shape to the Palestinian identity.

### How many people were displaced?

If you look it up on Wikipedia, the estimate given is 750'000. That's the size of a reasonably large city today. It's roughly the same population as Seattle. If some kind of political crisis happened that resulted in the United States forcibly removing everybody from Seattle, that would presumably be quite the tragedy and everybody would pay attention. Hurricane Katrina displaced about 1'000'000 million people from their homes. And in the case of Palestine, it wasn't just one city, but hundreds of small towns and villages throughout the region. And unlike after a hurricane, they weren't allowed to come back afterwards.

This type of forced relocation is viewed far more negatively in hindsight than it was back then. Today it seems people wouldn't even *consider* displacing a million people as part of a solution to some kind of conflict. But for much of history, the notion that a group of people is intimately or spiritually connected with any given area they happen to inhabit, and could never be forced to abandon that, was not present in most circumstances. The native populations of some place were often seen more as obstacles that we sometimes had to pick up and move around in order to secure some broader geopolitical goal. They'd get over it and settle elsewhere. This was happening in Asia, as the India--Pakistan partition took place. It was happening elsewhere in the Middle East. Even after World War II, there were massive population transfer in Europe that remade the continent, as borders shifted and Germans were expelled from central and eastern Europe. In the context of the world as it was in 1947, the expulsion of Arabs from much of Israel was not seen as a uniquely immoral event, much less a completely intolerable one. The Arab side refused to accept an international plan, they attacked, they lost, and now they're getting kicked out by the side who won. The notion that Israel is to this day not a legitimate state or a state which "has no right to exist" based on this initial action of expulsion is unrealistic, unpersuasive, and obviously not applied consistently.

Had it been a particularly noteworthy location---like an historical city like Constantinople, or a place of great religious importance like Mecca---then different considerations would likely have been made. But Palestine was more seen as some random plot of land, a name given to a sparsely populated rectangle on the outskirts of an empire that was no more. Its population was not seen as a distinct or special population with their own unique history or identity. They were just considered Arabs who could easily be moved around, and there were numerous other Arab countries they could go to. Forcing them to move was therefore not treated like a monumental travesty. It was more just part of the negotiation, a cost of doing business, all part of the process of trying to end up with borders that worked reasonably well for everybody once the dust settled.

There were many Palestinians who did simply leave, millions of them ending up in Jordan (another country that had emerged out of the Ottoman dissolution), where they settled and became a major part of the Jordanian population. This caused trouble in Jordan, though, where in 1951, Palestinians murdered the first King of Jordan, Abdullah, in response to fears that he may sign a peace treaty with Israel. To this day, the Palestinian population is unfortunately viewed negatively in the rest of the Arab world, not wanted in either Jordan or Egypt due to their propensity for violence and extremism. Whenever we hear about Israel blockading the Gaza strip, remember that Egypt was blockading them too.

### Why does the conflict persist to this day?

This is a question I remember having when I was first learning about the Israel--Palestine conflict. Imagine we *did* forcibly remove everybody from Seattle. That would understandably upset people, but would their grandchildren still be going on about it 80 years later? How haven't people built new lives and moved past this by now? The people who were kicked out in 1947 aren't even alive anymore. The Israeli leadership who kicked them out aren't alive anymore. Is this not a thing of the past by now? We should be able to acknowledge that Israel is a country whose founding involved expelling people from territory, an action that would be unacceptable today. But so many other country's histories also contain bad things. American Indians aren't resorting to terrorism and attacking the United States demanding to get their whole continent back. What keeps this particular fire burning?

The problem is this conflict was always put on hold and delayed just long enough for somebody to fire another shot and start things up again. This has been primarily the 'fault' of the Arab side, who have refused, for decades, to accept compromise that involved Israel existing in any form. The initial crime of Israel expelling people from its territory apparently could not be forgiven, and being vocally anti-Zionist was a way to become popular in the Arab world. They would proclaim their commitment to the destruction of Israel, and by the 1970s Israel had become the main representative of a perceived alliance between Jews and Christians in a global war against Islam or the Islamic world. But even before that, things had quickly stopped being about Israel and Zionism and became about Jews as a people. They talked so badly about Jewish people they might have felt at home in Nazi Germany. Their express goals weren't restitution for the families that were expelled from the region; it was the destruction of the entirety of Israel and the murder of all Jewish people therewithin, from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea. This isn't hyperbole---they proclaimed it explicitly.

In some sense, on some level, the reason the conflict still persists is the fact Israel is a Jewish rather than Muslim country. Why did all the Arab countries oppose the formation of Israel to begin with? Why did they reject the partition plan? Why have they rejected every attempt at compromise or partition since then? From the beginning, they hated the idea of Jewish people having political agency in a country where they get to be the majority instead of being ruled over by Muslims. This is also why the Muslim population opposes political autonomy for Christians, Zoroastrians, Yizidis, or any other non-Muslim religious group in the Middle East, while Islam itself is divided violently along the lines of its major sects (Sunni and Shia). In this part of the world, religion dominates everything, and Muslims want everything to be dominated by Islam. They would be happy to live under another caliphate. The founding of Israel was offensive to them because it wasn't Muslim. They escalated the conflict into war because Israel wasn't Muslim. And the conflict has been prolonged to this day because Jews aren't Muslims. For the Arabs outside of Palestine, in other Arab states, the fact Israel has mistreated a small number of Muslims by kicking them out of Palestine isn't a tragedy. It's a happy coincidence. It plays into their narrative and gives them something to use against Israel over, and over, and over again.

The Arab world has a vast amount of resources at their disposal. They could help the Palestinians. They don't. They could also take in the entire population of Gaza and the West Bank to their own countries, if they had to, but they won't do that either. The reality is they don't care that much about these people. For decades, the reason the Israel--Palestine conflict has continued and couldn't be resolved was because the Palestinian population had become a pawn in the game being played by Arab leaders. They were used as a bludgeon against Israel, a thorn in Israel's side. The Arab leadership didn't *want* the problem to be solved, nor did they want people to be able to move on, so much as they wanted to destroy Israel, and they would prolong the suffering of the Palestinian people if they thought it could help them accomplish that, just as Hamas does today. The Palestinian population was meanwhile sold the lie that the rest of the Arab world stood with them, and that if they just keep fighting---fight, fight, fight, always keep fighting---eventually they would win and take it all. Where has that got them?

And when I say the Arab side, in the past this would mean all the Arab countries. Today, a special emphasis needs to be placed on Iran. Iran is the one funding Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah. Part of the reason they do this is because, again, they don't want the Israel--Palestine conflict to be solved, and partly because they like instability and conflict in the region, especially between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

### Is Palestinian an ethnicity?

What even *is* a Palestinian? In the simplest sense, it's a person who lived in that region. There's debate about the extent to which it was even a thing before the 1940s, though. I'm currently given to believe that if you went back in time, the people who lived there before the 1920s wouldn't have identified as 'Palestinians'. They were Muslim Arabs whose leaders swore loyalty to the Ottomans. There was no particular stress or distinction placed on this location in the way that nationality or ethnicity typically implies.

20-3.png|This is the part of Ontario that I'm describing

I started thinking about my own country for comparison. Imagine if a political crisis resulted in the political isolation of a chunk of Ontario that wasn't our capital or major urban centres. Let's say that stretch of land north of Lake Huron, from Sault Ste. Marie to Sudbury. Imagine the United States annexed this region, put it under military rule, built a big fence around it, every so often going in to police the region to keep dissidents under control. Would the people in this area henceforth constitute an ethnicitiy? It isn't currently, and it would come across as strange if you today spoke of "the proud Sudburian ethnic group" or something like that. It's just a place in Ontario. There are people there, and some families have been there for generations, and you might meet somebody elsewhere in the country who says they're *from* Sudbury, but nobody talks about this place as though it's a distinct nation or ethnic group. It's by and large the same people and culture you'd find elsewhere in Canada.

However, if this imaginary annexation and subjugation of the territory were to happen, it's possible an ethnic identity would emerge. Though it's often used as though a synonym for genetic identity or racial group, in sociology an ethnicity is any group of people who perceive theirselves as distinct from those not in their group based on any perceived attributes. In theory, it can be a difference in language, culture, history, religion. It doesn't need to be racial. Having a shared experience can be the thing that constitutes an ethnogenesis, meaning the creation of a new ethnic identity. Russians and Ukrainians are not significantly genetically different, but today are different ethnicities due to their history diverging and resulting in linguistic and cultural differences. So even if at some point everybody in the Middle East were just ambiguously Arabs, but then one subset of Arabs were thrown out of their homes and forced to be refugees due to a conflict with Israel, that shared experience, hardship, and trauma can lead to those people forming a shared identity. And this isn't any less 'real' than other identities just because it's one that has emerged more recently in world history.

However, the only reason this matters is because the notion that "Palestinian" is a national identity or ethnic group makes the act of expelling them from their ancestral home of Palestine sound like an even worse action than it would've been otherwise---but again, the impression I get is that it wasn't really a distinct identity *at the time*. They were simply Arabs, not significantly different from the Arabs in all the surrounding territories. The distinction with which we speak of them today formed after, and in response to, Israel's national independence. If we're giving special attention to land claims that accompany distinct identities, our condemnation about that should not apply *ex post facto* to a case where the expulsion is the reason the identity is even there.

## Interpreting modern events

### Is Israel committing genocide?

"Genocide" has become the ultimate power-word and conversation-ender when it comes to this topic. It provides people an impenetrable feeling of moral superiority that allows them to turn their brain off and not engage in any further thought. If it's agreed that Israel is committing genocide, then obviously Israel is in the wrong. It therefore becomes very important to insist upon this claim, and not allow anybody to challenge it, because there are too many people who have rhetorically staked their positions on this premise.

"What is genocide?" isn't an uninteresting question, and it's not something that needs to be defined very strictly. It feels like a more spirit-of-the-law matter, anyhow. In other words, I doubt people who feel strongly about it would be persuaded if something were determined to be *sort of* genocide, but *technically* not. They would say 'close enough' or they take issue with us quibbling about where exactly the line is drawn.

There are numerous, conflicting attempts at giving the term a more specific definition, and the one laid out in the Geneva convention might be a compromise simply because it disappoints all parties equally. It *doesn't* include things that many people consider genocide, probably because the governments that formed its contents didn't want some of their own past actions to be condemnable on these grounds. Whatever the case, though, the uniting theme of any legal definition and of its more common understanding is genocide requires genocidal *intent*. It's not just any time a lot of people die. That's why the Allied forces in World War II killed a lot of Germans, but nobody thinks of this as a German genocide. We weren't trying to get rid of the German people.

There's a more expansive sense of genocide where it doesn't even need to be a genetic group, like the name seems to imply (*génos* + *-cide*). The way I think of it is that a genocidal mindset is when a person says "you know what? fuck this other group of people. I want this group gone. I want them to disappear and no longer exist so the world never has to deal with them ever again". If the group in question were Buddhists, and the mechanism of accomplishing this disappearance were to outlaw all aspects of Buddhist culture---destroy their temples, burn their books, jail their leaders---so that 'Buddhist' as an identifiable religious identity disappeared from society, then at the very least I must consider that *similar* to genocide, because if Buddhists *were* a genetic group, then people may indeed have resorted to trying to end their gene pool. Those measures only weren't necessary here because they could make the group 'disappear' in other ways.

This is why the term **cultural genocide**, or **culturicide**, was coined at the same time as genocide---to refer to when a society doesn't actually kill the genes of a group, but eliminates the social markers associated with the target identity through forced assimilation (e.g. destroy their religion and force them to worship our gods, outlaw their language and make them learn to speak ours, outlaw their traditional clothing and make them dress like us). This is the sense in which it may feel appropriate to speak of a "transgender genocide"---not as meaning the mass murder of trans people, but policies that are reflective of a genocidal mindset. If trans people *were* a racial minority, like Jewish, Romani, or Armenian people, which would ultimately disappear from the world if they don't reproduce, they would be at risk of actual genocide in the world today. When that guy made news a couple years ago by getting on stage at that one event, and talking about how he wanted to "eradicate transgenderism from society"---that is somebody who wants the trans population to disappear, to never be seen or heard from again. That is, at least to some degree, a genocidal mindset. There's a big difference between this and wanting some kind of reform or change within the population in question. If somebody believes there's an issue with Romani people where they're very prone to criminal behaviour---like pickpocketing people in busy tourist areas---we could make it our goal to do something about that, to change the behaviour of the people in that group, to figure out how to lower the crime rate in their community. That's the level some people are at when it comes to gay or transgender people---but others are more extreme, and don't want to solve problems, they don't want to improve things, they don't want to help the group in question better integrate into civil society. They just want the group to disappear forever.

The question I've been leading up to is: does Israel have a genocidal intent, or is this just a violent conflict? In other words, does Israel want Palestinians to disappear? Do they want this group to cease existing, to live in a world without them, and are they taking actions to that end? Are they trying to eradicate the Palestinians? I don't see how any of the history or events could be fairly interpreted to support that conclusion. Israel is conducting a war against an enemy that has declared war on them, and which is intent to *continue* declaring war on them until the end of time. And it's this enemy who has no regard for Palestinian lives. We've seen, from their own actions, that Hamas would throw Palestinians into a furnace and burn them for fuel if they thought doing so powered a machine that allowed them to murder more Jews. It's broadly undisputed at this point that Hamas uses human shields, meaning they deliberately put civilians in harm's way as a deterrent. They operate in or under schools and hospitals, in urban centres. They don't use any of their resources to protect civilians, because they don't want to. They view a higher civilian death toll as excellent propaganda in the war of public opinion against Israel. They don't follow any of the rules of warfare. They don't care about any international law. They don't care if anything they do is a war crime. It must be really difficult to be at war with people who act like this, who have no standards for theirselves, and to then have everybody hold you to a really high standard.

Israel has historically been the more compromising power. They make concessions, they withdraw from territory, they sign treaties. And when they attack these regions---after being attacked for years, and deciding they finally can't take it anymore and have to do something, because the status quo is no longer tolerable---they drop leaflets announcing their intent ahead of time, they give civilians time to flee the area, they tell people where to go. As far as I'm aware, Israel does more than any other fighting force to try and reduce civilian deaths, because they know they're fighting an enemy that's trying to increase them.

The narrative that this is all tantamount to genocide relies on speculation and conspiracy thinking: the idea that Israel has some kind of secret, decades-long plot to slowly, but surely, in the view of the entire world, eradicate the Palestinian population one small step at a time---despite that population increasing substantially over time, and despite none of Israel's present-day actions indicating this is the case. There's no counter-evidence that could disprove a theory like this, because they just write it all off as Israel doing things for plausible deniability because they're trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the entire world. It has apparently spanned across numerous different waves of Israeli leadership, and fails to explain many of Israel's actions and decision points, but it has an enduring appeal.

The accusation requires us looking at a series of events---Israel getting dragged into wars by Arab states that wanted to destroy it---and ignoring the more obvious, more plausible explanations that better fit the facts. Since the 1940s, Israel has been responding to the reality on the ground that people around them want them all dead. Every time there's a mass death event, a mass expulsion of people, or Israel expanding its forces into other territories, it's only happened because Israel was explicitly threatened or attacked by the territories around it. I find this is a much better way of understanding Israel's actions than supposing there's a genocidal intent behind everything they're doing.

Seeing a complex landscape of facts and trying to find one magical answer that somehow solves for and explains everything is a thought-pattern that I typically associate with conspiracy theorists. It's part of what makes them so alluring: the feeling that you've stumbled upon some incredible revelation that, once you found it, made you feel like your eyes have been opened---suddenly everything makes sense, everything is connected, and you see confirmations of it everywhere you look.

I'm not writing this part because I think it will be persuasive. I don't expect anybody is going to react well to being told "your beliefs are like a conspiracy theory". It's not an argument. It's just a report of how I honestly feel about the way some people talk about the issue. It feels like talking to conspiracy theorists. They just have a grand supposition that connects everything, doesn't require strong evidence, more like "hey, wouldn't it be crazy if such and such? actually, if it were true, that would explain a lot", and they go from there. And they act so sure of it, so convinced of it, because they've already invested so much on the assumption, that for it to not be true would be narrative-breaking. It would break their world. So they can't compromise on that line. And in their view, I'm ridiculous. I'm the crazy person who doesn't see the obvious truth plainly in front of me,

### Is Israel engaging in ethnic cleansing?

They might be, sort of. It depends what we mean by that. The term ethnic cleansing is more wiggly than some of these other terms. I'm not even sure what major examples come to mind for most people if you asked them for examples of ethnic cleansing in history. The Armenians from Turkey? The Indians in early America?

I think the problem with calling it ethnic cleansing is that they have people of the same ethnicity in their country whom they're not trying to get rid of. So is it a campaign against an ethnicity?

Imagine if in Turkey, there were Armenians all throughout the country, but then in one part of Turkey, there was a province with an Armenian majority that was effectively ruled over by gangs or paramilitary groups, and they were opposing the government, and then a conflict occurred because of that. If they said "right, we're going to kick out every Armenian person from Turkey", then I guess that's "ethnic cleansing", because they're removing an ethnicity from the region. But what if they said "right, we're going to kick out all the people from this one province", and Armenians in other places were left alone? How does that work? Would we call that an ethnic cleansing? What if we also kicked out all the non-Armenians too, and it just happened to be an Armenian-majority region, and Armenians elsewhere in the country were left alone? By that point, "ethnic cleansing" is clearly not appropriate. And that's more like what's happening in Israel, in the worst case scenario, if Israel decided to push every single person out of Gaza. And they're not even doing that.

Why isn't it just considered a political conflict?

I just had a thought: if the United States deports a bunch of illegal immigrants, is that ethnic cleansing because if they're all Mexicans? Even though that's not the criteria that's used to determine whether a person gets deported or not? When you're in the magical land of "intentions don't matter", all these categories become difficult to work with.

### Is Israel an apartheid state?

The term 'apartheid' comes from South Africa. It meant "apartness" or something. It described how that country was strictly racially segregated. It was basically a race-based caste system. Whether you were black, white, Indian, or something else, would determine where you were allowed to live, what kind of jobs you could have, what schools you or your child could go to. There is nothing remotely like this in Israel. There is no segregation in Israel. There is no race-based anything in Israel. There's really nothing about the application of this term that makes any sense here. I discredit anybody who casually repeats that Israel is an apartheid state, as though what they're repeating is some kind of obvious conventional wisdom, and not a view that one *could* argue in favour of, but for which you'd need to actually make the argument. Apartheid was a fairly unique situation. The only society that's comparable is the United States during the era of Jim Crow laws, which were some regional or state-level laws in 20th century America that enforced race-based segregation of public institutions from schools to restaurants to public washrooms and drinking fountains.

<!-- "huh-guy a'lawd of bet-sell'em" -->

There were some articles a few years ago where an Israeli human rights organization called B'Tselem was declaring that Israel is an apartheid state because they treat citizens differently from non-citizens---like every other country. How did this get taken seriously? Hagai El-Ad, the group's director, published an article in The Guardian titled "We are Israel's largest human rights group and we are calling this apartheid". The fact this organization is located in Israel makes their opinions appear very significant to people in the West, even though there's a huge diversity of opinion within Israel, a country with liberal free speech laws where you're allowed to criticize and protest the government all day if you want to. The contents of the article are a mix of conjecture, fact, and feeling. He says everything about Israel follows from an organizing principle of supremacy of Jews over Palestinians and repeats "this is apartheid". Even though he acknowledges it has none of the features of apartheid, he twists himself into using this word anyway by calling it "our version" and "apartheid 2.0". If he's acknowledging that Palestinians who aren't citizens can't vote, but the Palestinians who are citizens can, then how is anybody supposed to conclude this is anything like apartheid? It's evident just from the text of this article that it's not a race-based domination. There is no fixed racial caste. Were there black people in South Africa who had full rights as long as they were citizens? What are we talking about, and how stupid can this guy think the public is?

It could be true that if I went to Israel, I'd get the feeling that people around me do kind of think they're better than Palestinians. That's the case in many countries around the world, about groups they're at conflict with. This isn't even worth trying to dispute, because it's not a crime. And if I were in Palestine, I could imagine also getting the feeling that people around me don't like Jews very much.

There's something curious happening when it's being called apartheid 2.0, or "a modern form of" apartheid---a sentiment not unique to this article. It's apartheid, people say, but not like South African apartheid (i.e. the main, or only, version that we know, once again raising the question of why we're using this word if it's not like the only thing the word refers to?). It's a new, different kind of apartheid---apartheid for the 21st century. This is very effective rhetoric because it's tricky to disprove, as pointing out how different they are suddenly doesn't matter, or doesn't register as a refutation. "Of course they're different---that's why it's called 2.0. You wouldn't expect Toy Story 2 to be the exact same as Toy Story 1, would you?" But then what's the throughline here? Can I just say anything is the 2.0 version of some other thing? How do we justify that being so in the first place? There has to be some kind of relevant connection that we agree is the essential or defining quality of the first thing, which carries on into the second. Let's consider a couple examples.

* **Slavery.** In the past, slavery was *de jure* property ownership of another person. You are my slave, I own you, you are my property, the same way that my car and my bed are my mine. Today, that's not how it works anymore, but we still call it slavery. We make a distinction by calling it modern slavery, which gets overlapped with human trafficking, forced labour, or other terms like this to describe similar things. This often takes the form of people being physically threatened if they don't work. It often takes the form of sex work. It's not legal and there is no *de jure* property claim, but the person is still effectively controlled, forced to labour, and not allowed to leave. There has been concern about foreign workers in Qatar being brought into the country as temp workers, but then paid a pittance and not allowed to leave the country, practically restricted from leaving their job, while also being denied various rights because they're just foreign workers, and some find people view this as tantamount to slavery because they can end up being stuck with no other options but to work or die. It's more convoluted than chains.
We call these things slavery despite how they differ from systems in the past because it seems like these things only happen because the more direct, historical form of slavery---now called 'chattel slavery'---isn't legal anymore. If it were, that's probably what they'd still be doing. The goal is the same: make use of their labour, while not giving them rights, and restricting their freedom as much as possible to prevent them from leaving the arrangement. There's a throughline in terms of what these practices achieve, the intent of the people doing them, and the effect it has on the victims.

* **Neo-Nazism.** The term neo-Nazism can lead us to similar issues at times. The criteria for calling somebody a Nazi used to be rather concrete: they supported Nazi Germany, or they adhered to the Nazi ideology (culminating in support for a dictatorship that tries to exterminate people they deem inferior---the disabled people, other races, the homoseks, etc.). What makes somebody a neo-Nazi, on the other hand? Is it just a matter of what symbols they use? The 'neo-' prefix adds a lot of ambiguity when used among people who didn't get their credit in far-right social studies. But there is a coherent meaning to neo-Nazism as something distinct from Nazism, but it refers to the evolution of Nazi ideas that can be traced through different generations of Nazi thinkers and organizations. It's not just another, different set of views that existed or formed independently and which we disparage by relating to Nazism because we thought they sounded similar. It's actually the result of people who found the original Nazism appealing, but thought it needed to be updated or reformed in order to be more compatible with or palatable within the modern world or people's modern sensibilities. They make different arguments, they have different goals, but there's an undercurrent of thought and attitude that connects them, as well as a direct line of influence as the torch was passed down. (They also made it easy for us by reüsing Nazi symbols and in many cases plainly calling theirselves Nazis, without much regard for this distinction.)

So it's not invalid to say that one thing is the 'new version' of something else. When I say Israel isn't an apartheid state, it's not just because I'm grasping for straws and dismissing it for having some different surface-level features (like saying "this can't be slavery, because they aren't doing farm labour"). It's because there needs to be some kind of core, essential, or underlying theme, attitude, idea, or a continuity of relations or influence, in order for us to connect a line from one thing to another.

The stronger case for there being an overlap in function or effect is not about Israel proper but the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. If your position is that Israel's actions in the West Bank are unjustified in some way, that could be a reasonable position, as I'll explain later. But why is Israel in the West Bank? It's not because there's a race-based caste system they're trying to impose. It's not because they're trying to attack people for being Muslims. Israel has sought good relations with other countries whose populations are more or less identical in genetics and religious belief. The Israeli presence in the West Bank is a military occupation that arose out of conflicts about borders and national defense. We could sure find things to compare it with in history, but it wouldn't be South Africa.

Military occupation is an unspecific term for when a region is taken over by a military that's not its own. For example, during World War II, some parts of Germany were put under military occupation by Allied forces. Did they have to let the Germans in those towns vote in American elections while the military was there? If not, does that mean those Germans lived under apartheid?

What about the idea that citizenship is based on race? It would be quite the trick if South Africa were to only grant citizenship to white people and then claim they're not enforcing racial barriers, but giving a normal amount of privilege to citizens. But there is no racial boundary in citizenship. Nor is there a religious one. There are Muslim, Palestinian Arabs who are Israeli citizens. They vote in Israeli elections. The stars are not aligning here.

It is true that it's easier for people with Jewish ancestry to become citizens. There's also many other countries who extend this courtesy to their own diaspora throughout the world. Jewish people fled and spread out across other countries because they were a powerless, persecuted minority group. Now that there's finally a country where Jews have a stable population, is the idea that they're not allowed to offer their own people easier citizenship if they come home, otherwise that's a horrific system of racial domination? And yes, this isn't a unique policy. I don't think the fact it's easier for people with Irish ancestry to get Irish citizenship means Ireland is an apartheid state either.

The less-obvious downside of having this conversation is the other, potential conversations that we could've been having instead. We should be talking about the military occupation of the West Bank for what it is. We think of a military occupation as something that can be justified temporarily in war, not as something that becomes a new state of affairs and goes on for another 50 years. Would it be acceptable if the US were still ruling over parts of Germany today? Perhaps if the territory were not merely occupied but annexed and taken over, made part of their country. But in that case, Israel *would* need to accept responsibility for the people of the West Bank. We should expect they be given Israeli citizenship and all rights that accompany it. But that's not what Israel is doing or interested in doing. It's not an annexation. They aren't declaring that the West Bank is part of Israel. And this sort of **strategic ambiguity** should be the focus of criticism.

### Indiscriminate bombing and 'dumb bombs'

To kill *indiscriminately* means to not care who you're hurting, to make no distinction between your target and a casualty. For a military to kill indiscriminately is, in most contexts, a serious accusation. The nuclear bombs dropped on Japan killed Japanese people indiscriminately, meaning we didn't care *which* Japanese people we killed (though we did target Japan, as opposed to just any random humans on the planet, so I guess it's all about scope). To say that Israel is indiscriminately killing Palestinians would imply that Israeli forces are shooting or bombing any random Palestinian they see, without regard for who they are. I've never heard of any evidence that this is happening. Israel clearly cares about target selection. They don't just kill whoever they see. They try to target militants.

If you feel that Israel ends up killing too many civilians (however you even determine that), then you should be outraged at Hamas for forcing Israel to fight in civilian areas, for the fact that Hamas deliberately fights in civilian clothing, and does nothing to protect their civilian population. The fact it's so difficult to engage in combat with Hamas without civilian casualties isn't merely Hamas's fault, it's the result that Hamas consciously wanted. Israel tries to minimize civilian casualties while Hamas tries to maximize them, because they realized that their own civilians dying makes Israel look bad. Are these the people you're siding with?

I don't know why so many people started repeating this line that Israel is "indiscriminately bombing Palestinians". Maybe they just heard somebody else say it and they're repeating it without even really thinking about what it means, because I've actually stopped many conversations to ask people what they think it means, and then to provide any evidence that it's happening, and in most cases they either didn't know the meaning or had no idea how to substantiate it. They just said it.

Joe Biden said this at some point, by the way, as early as December 2023. "[Israel] has most of the world supporting it", but "they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place." He doesn't elaborate and nobody challenges or questions that statement, so it just randomly went on record, and a bunch of people saw a headline of Biden using that word. He may have significantly contributed to its use.

The idea that Israel is just randomly throwing bombs into Gaza without regard for who the bombs hit may have come from the notion that Israel uses dumb bombs, and misunderstandings about the implications of that very fact.

A dumb bomb is an unguided munition, which is what all munitions were until we invented guided munitions, or smart bombs, in the mid-1900s, which had an onboard computer and sensor system that can steer itself. It didn't become common to actually utilize them until the 90s, and now they're becoming more normal---but we obviously don't think that all bombing prior to the last few decades was 'indiscriminate'. That would be an insane thing to claim.

I'm not a munitions expert, but I get the sense the difference between using guided and unguided munitions isn't as great as people think when you're just blowing up a large, stationary target like a building. And for some reasons, Israel has been denied shipments of smart munitions by some countries, including the US, leaving them with only access to unguided munitions.

(By the way, indiscriminate bombing is exactly what Gazans do to Israelis any time they can.)

### The pager attack

In 2024, a bunch of pagers exploded in Lebanon. The next day, walkie-talkies. They were specifically the devices sold to members of Hezbollah, the terrorist group that's taken over southern Lebanon.

I recall people messaging me after that attack, asking what I thought, hoping that I'd condemn it. Not only do I not condemn it, but I don't see why it's not preferable to any other method of attack Israel could've pursued. They figured out a way to precision-target Hezbollah members: target the devices they were using to communicate with each other. It's a creative way of distinguishing between the actual militants and the civilian population. I realize there were some civilian injuries, but overall very few, and it's not like there's ever zero in war. Imagine we had the opportunity to bomb a house where all the top Nazis were having a meeting, but there were also some civilian cooks or other servants attending who would die. That would *obviously* be seen as an unfortunately cost necessary to take out valid military targets.

I remember some of the most anti-Israel people calling it a terrorist attack. It was *literally* terrifying in the sense it scared people, perhaps. If I were walking down the street, and I didn't realize the guy in front of me was a literal terrorist, and his phone suddenly exploded, then yeah, I might be freaked out a bit. But that's not actually what terrorism is. I read an article by somebody who said after this attack, every single person in the Middle East has to be scared their devices might blow up at any time if the IDF wants them dead. This is only true in the stupidest sense possible. If there's a war, and the enemy planes bomb a legitimate military target, like a military outpost full of soldiers in our military, then should I be scared that my house might be next? It could get bombed in the same way, by those same planes. It could happen. They have planes. They could fly over here and blow me up in my house. They could bomb my neighbourhood. By this logic, virtually any act of war is an act of terrorism, because it's a demonstration that you *could* attack the civilian population instead, and that makes them scared.

This reaction was just a way to spin the situation against Israel, even though it's an instance of Israel doing the exact opposite of targeting the civilian population, the exact opposite of the thing everybody is always trying to accuse them of (not caring about the militant--civilian distinction).

## How to move forward

### What could Israel do to end the conflict?

Israel's current borders weren't agreed to diplomatically. They were armistice lines, meaning the implicit boundaries between sides during a war, like what you might see on a map of Europe half-way through WWII, or a map of the Russia--Ukraine war right now. When the fighting stopped, the dust settled, and that's where the lines remained. Israel didn't have the population nor military might to expand and hold territory without limit. They weren't conquerors. They could just barely manage to keep the land they inhabited.

**The situation Israel ended up in was this:** there are two regions on either side of the country they can't control, conquer, deport, or police. And the population of these two places both want to declare war on you and kill all your people. What do you do? It's a situation they can't deal with. A situation of their own making, you might say, but after some point that doesn't matter---they don't have a time machine to change the past. What do they do now?

For the latter part of the 20th century, there was basically nothing Israel could have done to create peace short of self-destruction, either in the form of all leaving the region or giving up on their political independence and allowing the region to be overtaken by a Muslim majority---which, given their experience in Europe after the Holocaust, and given the violently anti-Jewish nature of the population in question here, was obviously and understandably unacceptable. Ideally separation should eventually have led to peace, but that's not how things work out if one side is completely unsatisfied with separation because they demand your defeat at all costs and believe they have the power to accomplish that.

Today a solution proposed by critics of Israel is for Israel to end their blockade of Gaza and withdraw all presence from the West Bank, at least. These are agreeable goals, but Israel doesn't do these things for no reason. A huge portion of the people in Gaza do want to kill them all. The region does descend into being ruled by organized terrorist groups who want to wage against Israel. They take in substantial resources from outside, and they funnel those resources into trying to build bombs and other weapons, which they use to try and murder random Israelis. The Israeli blockade isn't there simply as a means to harm Gaza and keep them down; it's self-defensively motivated. Their presence in the West Bank is similar, except they can't possibly blockade that region as they can with Gaza. And for the people of Israel---who feel they're at war and that these people want to exterminate them and have been terrorizing their side for decades---simply backing off like this is a big ask. When a nation is attacked and given a *casus belli*, we don't demand they sit on their hands, even though that *would* result in peace. It becomes unfortunately unrealistic: almost nobody who feels they've just been attacked simply values peace. They want to respond. They care about the precedent being set for the future, they demand answers, they want to know this isn't just going to happen again. If you forgive and capitulate and appease, the problem often gets worse, not better. And that would be the case here. If Israel ended their blockade of Gaza, would the result be peace, or Hamas importing more weapons and getting ready for their next attack?

This does get more complicated with the West Bank, as there are some elements within Israel who want to rule the West Bank for religious, historical regions, even referring to this as "Greater Israel", which it's implied they have some kind of Biblical claim to. There are, moreover, people within Israel who feel total withdraw from the West Bank would be insufficient and solve nothing---those who want them dead before would still want them dead afterwards. It would be surrendering strategic territory for essentially no reason. The religious aspect of Israeli politics that aspires to reclaim some kind of historical Judea *is* a problem, but it's not also the dominant, majority voice in the country. It's just one of many voices present. The US Congress has some unreasonable people in it, too.

Gaza and the West Bank, when left to their own devices, fall apart into chaos and get taken over by extremist groups. They aren't stable regions, they don't have functioning institutions, the population is young and susceptible to radicalization. How do you fix this? There probably needs to be some kind of external, stabilizing element, and that being Israel itself is going to be rejected. It would be nice if Egypt, Jordan, or any other more stable Arab country that could control this population and prevent them from being terrorists and funnelling all their resources into trying to shoot rockets at Israelis, but those countries have no interest in doing this, because---as noted before---they would prefer the Palestinians linger around like this because it puts endless pressure on Israel, and because they don't want the trouble of dealing with the Palestinians in their own countries, nor committing the resources to come in and govern these places.

By the 21st century, Arab countries' attitudes toward Israel have shifted. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon---the actual governments of these other countries have largely abandoned the hope that if they carry on fighting, forever they'll eventually destroy Israel. The people who started these wars have died of old age; the people now in charge were born into conflict. They've become more interested in moving on, finding a way, and normalizing relations---and diversifying their economies. Things haven't fully developed in that way yet (*officially*, some of these countries, like Saudi Arabia, still don't even recognize Israel as a country), but that's the direction it's moved in, and is still moving in. For this reason, I feel there's more opportunity now, in theory, for Israel to normalize relations with the Palestinians by trying to directly help develop and improve these regions---but they likely can't force this outcome by theirselves.

What should Israel do? Leave the West Bank, you say. But if they leave the West Bank, what happens? If Israel up and leaves, the people in the West Bank start prepping for war. It just kicks the can down the road, and by the time you catch up with it again, the problem will be worse, not better. This is the bind Israel finds itself in: the conditions for their military occupation to end aren't being met. They can't just leave, they can't absorb the territory, and they can't expel everybody out of the territory, at least not without massive international condemnation. Here, like on other fronts, it can feel there's no right answer.

### What could Palestinians do to end the conflict?

This part of the conversation is difficult because the Palestinian population is generally treated as though it has no agency. And there is some truth to that. There are some valid reasons for why they do have less agency than other populations. For one, the average age in the region is very low. They're less educated, less organized, less wealthy, and frankly they've been propagandized for the last few generations. They have television, but they also have TV stations run by terrorist networks. They have children's programming created by fascistic Jihadists whose goal is teaching children born into Gaza about the evil of Jews. This population is not in a good state economically, socially, or mentally. So what can I realistically ask of them? This is an unfortunate barrier because a change in Palestinian people would be more impactful than similar changes among any other population. They have the most potential.

If Arab leadership outside of Palestine (and to clarify: 'Palestine' means Gaza and the West Bank) wanted to make this fabled "peace in the Middle East" happen, a key to reaching that outcome is figuring out how to regulate, deradicalize, and control the Palestinians---not to enslave them, but to control them as the governments of other countries control their own populations, by enforcing laws, and preventing violent paramilitary groups from running the streets and indoctrinating children, to prevent people from pouring all their resources into making rockets because they've come to believe their main purpose in life is trying to murder Jews. The conversation ends up feeling like we're talking about a friend who's a drug addict. We can say "they need to quit the drugs" all day long. And in a simple sense, that's true. It would solve the problem. But it's also a complicated thing to demand. They might need help.

But Palestinians don't have no agency at all. We talk about how many people there are in Palestine below the age of 18, but there's also plenty of adults. It's not impossible for people there to move in the direction of saying they don't want this to go on forever, and they need to recognize a different path to go down, one that isn't infinite, endless Jihad and warfare. Whether it comes from outside or in, what the Palestinian population needs to do is accept that Israel isn't going away, it's not getting wiped off the map. They need to focus on making life better for their own people. If they weren't constantly plotting and trying to kill the Jews, eventually the blockade would end, and their own lives could carry on. Israel isn't a repressive dictatorship whose public just wants blood and retribution for no reason. They want protection. And there are many people in Israel who are critical of the country's actions. They have plenty of public discourse and care about the morality of what they do. If Hamas and groups like them weren't regularly proving the need for Israel's policies, eventually the public would say, hey, wait, why are we blockading these people? What's the point? And it would be taken down.

### The two-state solution

The state-state solution sounds like the most obvious thing ever. It's what you're supposed to say if you just want to be normal, uncontroversial, and signal that you value life on both sides. It almost feels like you're not even taking a side. There's two populations that don't get along, but they reside in two separate territories with a clear boundary between them. Why not just declare these separate countries, let them organize their own governments, and have peace through separation?

In the past, Israel was willing to do that. It was the Arabs who opposed it. The Arabs always wanted *more*---more than whatever was offered to them. Even to this day, many anti-Zionists oppose a two-state solution because a two-state solution implies that Israel gets to keep existing. It's difficult to compromise with that level of extremism. They *need* Israel to be destroyed---either through the violent expulsion all Jews from the region (there *are* many people who want this), or by dismantling the country as it currently is and replacing it with a Muslim-majority state, leaving Jews to once again be a powerless minority living under another people's authority. Jews have no reason to expect anything other than oppression under such an arrangement. It simply cannot be accepted.

This uncompromising extremism is why over time, Israel has changed its position from being willing to compromise through a two-state solution to opposing that. How can you just back off and grant political independence to the same people declaring Jihad against you and trying to murder your people, your civilians? That is not a solution, but a delay---giving them time to regroup and reload. If any of us were Israeli, none of us would accept this.

I have come to think that if there is a solution ahead, "one-state or two-state?" is the wrong question. There will be Israel, and then somebody else probably needs to step in and do something about the Palestinians, because their independence at this point spells only perpetual war. What if other Arab countries were to step up and take over these regions? Egypt takes over Gaza, Jordan takes over the West Bank---but I don't think those two countries are capable of doing so right now, so perhaps other countries, like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, also commit to helping the situation. The point is Israel cannot do this alone. The Palestinians will likely not like this, and the rest of the world must reply, 'too bad'.

Then you need a narrative shift in the culture. They need to stop pushing anti-Jewish propaganda that's meant to incite the people in these regions to perpetual hatred and warfare. Teach them to be peaceful, tell them to accept their current borders, tell them that life can get better if they make peace. This needs to be a concerted effort akin to denazification in post-war Germany, which is not something Israel is equipped to do. It's not something the people are going to accept coming from them. They may be more inclined to accept it coming from their fellow Arabs and Muslims.

## Some final words

I just want to reiterate that I completely get where people are coming from on an emotional level when they look at the conflict, they see a powerful military fighting a bunch of ragtag poor people in what looks like a slum, and naturally are wary of the powerful military. I had that same kind of pause at first. None of us want to support the oppressors. I would also be a more popular person, and endure less cnoflict, if I didn't care, never looked into it, or just gave up and called Israel and apartheid state like everybody else. Being true to yourself has consequences. And for me, that means acknowledging that the more I thought and read about this topic, the more I came to feel the Israeli side really is the more reasonable one.

I think most people I know lean against Israel, and this is truer today than it was five years ago. Israel has been losing in the court of public opinion. I believe we live in a heavily anti-Israel biased media environment, so much so that many people don't even realize it anymore. They're like fish in water. It's worse in alternative or independent media commentary on social media. Today there exists whole networks of people trying to control the online narrative surrounding Israel, pushing anti-Zionist viewpoints in every comment section across TikTok, Reddit, Quora, Twitter, YouTube---you name it, and there's group chats somewhere dedicated to brigading it. There's a whole radicalization pipeline that centres around just this one issue.

It's been tricky to even have conversations about it without some people writing me off as being evil. It's difficult for them to imagine a person disagreeing with them while being truthful and well-meaning. I think Palestinians are our fellow human beings and how we treat our enemies matters. But if I push back against anything on this topic, even the strongest anti-Israeli talking points, there will be people who leap to thinking I just hate Arabs or Muslims, I think they're scum, I think they're uncivilized, they're animals, they're incapable of peace, and I hope Israel wipes them all out, and really everything I say about this topic is for the purpose of covering up my own genocidal intentions.

I can relate to that sort of projection because at times it's difficult for me to *not* think anti-Zionists just hate Jews. They have a fixation on Israel because it's a Jewish country while ignoring all the other wars and conflicts in the world. They think Israel somehow controls the West, it controls America, it controls the American military and Congress, it controls all our media. They care a lot about international law---but only when Israel is breaking it. They don't go on about how everybody in the Middle East breaks international law, about how Israel's enemies openly and proudly shout their desire to enact genocide against the Jews. No, no, they only focus on, and only talk about, international law insofar as they want it to be followed by Israel, the only country in the region that's held to any standard and expected to restrain itself. Why? Why are they so biased? What is it about Israel that shifts their perspective so? The only Jewish country, you say?

But no. There are other reasons a person would be critical of Israel, and even fixated on it, due to our different relations with this country compared with others. I don't think criticizing Israel means you hav ea thing about Jews, but some of the people I talk to probably do. And some of the people who defend Israel may well be that caricature I was describing before. There is indeed racism against Palestinians, bias against Islam, against the Middle East. I've heard it, I don't like it, and I argue against it. We need to be able to hear each other without only assuming the worst of intentions or grouping in every opposing voice we hear with the worst of what our opposition has to offer.

If my views or attitude about this topic change significantly at some point in the future, I'll hopefully make another post where I describe in what way that happens. I'm not unmovingly committed to anything that I've said here and I'm open to dialogue about any of it.
