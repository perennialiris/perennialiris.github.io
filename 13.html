# The military--industrial complex |2024-12-04

||indent
"Elon Musk is right. The Pentagon, with a budget of $886 billion, just failed its 7th audit in a row. It's lost track of billions. Last year, only 13 senators voted against the Military Industrial Complex and a defense budget full of waste and fraud. That must change."[](https://x.com/SenSanders/status/1863268770371772863)
--- US Senator Bernard Sanders, 2024-12-01

$This tweet by Sanders was broadly celebrated by the American right wing, not only because he opens it with positivity about Elon Musk, but because conspiracy theorism has become vital to right-wing politics, and Sanders is playing into one of the oldest and most far-reaching conspiracies of all by invoking the infamous 'military--industrial complex', a term used to imply that our governments are secretly being controlled by nefarious entities that profit from sending our people off to die in war.

The term originates in a speech by US President Eisenhower in 1961 and has never gone away. What exactly Eisenhower meant is unclear and debated, but also no longer matters. By this point the phrase has taken on a life of its own---though getting to act like you're only expressing the same concern Eisenhower was does bestow an unearned appearance of credibility.

War is a terrible thing, and nobody is comfortable with the idea that we march into war not because the alternative is the triumph of evil but because we've been manipulated into doing so by somebody who stands to make a lot of money if we do. And that was sort of the case long ago. If two kingdoms went to war, things worked out well financially for the winner. But today this is an imaginary problem. There are companies that can benefit from selling things to the military or getting contracts to build things, but the economy in general suffers far more when armies usurp our labour force, destroy productive infrastructure, and halt the trade of goods and services across borders. Indeed, the most powerful companies in any modern economy are the ones whose interests are wholly against armed conflict. When war *does* happen, they'll try to get in and sell things to the military, obviously, but that's just them making the best of the situation life has dealt them. I'm sure Dell would like to sell the defense department computers or something, but there's an enormous chasm between that and our foreign policy initiatives secretly being set by the Dell board of directors.

It's become all the more important to combat conspiracy theorism. Humans are imaginative, and conspiracy theories play into that. Talk about the 'military--industrial complex' is largely baseless, but it also stokes people to be against our own governments and militaries, which is only a short distance upstream from being against our countries and the West in general. If you're misled to believe that war only happens because oil execs and arms manufacturers pay our governments to go to war so they can make money, then I can understand your view of the world being dismal, your becoming slowly disillusioned with the system, your no longer viewing us as a force for good in the world. And when the next war happens, perhaps you'll be sympathetic with our enemies, to a point of siding with them against us.

It's not outside the realm of possibility for us to become the bad guys. But if you're a conspiracy theorist, you're also a prime candidate for making up your own reality, because you can just question everything contrary to the most convincing narrative in your head. Suddenly it's all conspiracy, it's all a lie, it's all a cover-up. If you want to understand how somebody in the West could end up thinking Russia or China or ISIS or Iran are actually the good guys today, and maybe the Allied powers weren't really the good guys in World War II, this is how. It begins with distrust, first of one thing, and then with time, of everything.

And Mr. Sanders isn't innocent for the role he's playing in this, because the conspiracy aspect of what he's implying is exactly what he's meaning to imply. It's not a mistake. He's ideologically opposed to the US military and American foreign interventionism, and ergo is happy to utilize conspiracy thinking to poison public discourse against it. Bernie isn't a teenager who's reading about this stuff on the internet for the first time while listening to Rage Against the Machine. He's 83 years old and just got reÃ«lected to his fourth term in the Senate.

He *probably* doesn't fully recognize the extent to which conspiracy thinking has helped the Republican Party. They've capitalized on anti-US conspiracy thinking, especially among people today who think of theirselves as 'anti-war', in a way that amounts to thinking perhaps we should stand by and allow Russia to annex territory from a country that was once our ally and that we said we had a commitment to protect. No, no, that's just a consequence of the military--industrial complex, right? These are people who lived through the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. They bought into the oversimplified 'blood for oil' explanation of those conflicts, and they might remember American and British leadership claim the Iraqi government was secretly harbouring weapons of mass destruction, or WMDs, to justify attacking that country.

In hindsight this is regarded as a lie and taken as evidence you can't trust anybody and that your leaders will lie to your face to pull you into unjustified wars (probably because the military--industrial complex tells them to). Ever since, a certain subset of the population has been hanging onto this failure and viewing all international conflict through that lens. They distrust seemingly *everything* related to military or intelligence. They can reply to any claim by asking, "Is this coming from the same people who lied about Iraq having WMDs?"---and just like that, in their mind it's all been discredited. If they could be sent back to the 1930s, they would oppose standing up to the Nazis.

While you're here: the way we remember events is often reduced to a sentence or two. Bush lied, people died, something like that? In the case of the Iraq war, it should probably be politicians exaggerated---or maybe gambled, depending on what they truly believed. Saddam Hussein had indeed used WMDs on his people in the past, and the country did turn out to have an active nuclear weapons program. It just wasn't as far along in their development as a working bomb as people feared. So you might think the Bush administration just made that up, but the fear wasn't unfounded. The problem is we don't have a direct line to what people at the CIA believed. They tell the president, and the president talks to the press. My bet is the CIA had mostly-accurate information, and they knew what stuff was partly speculation, what they knew for sure, what was confirmed and what was only likely, etc.---but all that nuance got fucked up when it passed through the politicians, who then walked out and said what they thought they needed to.

Wait, let's get back to Sanders.

In that same tweet, Sanders ignorantly plays into another conspiracy-adjacent belief, which is the idea that the military, especially the US military, is uniquely plagued with fraud and waste, but the vast majority of elected representatives are all so brainwashed (probably by the military--industrial complex) they just choose to look the other way and let it continue. We give billions to the Pentagon, and it all just disappears. It's a black hole, the money just vanishes. That's why we could save a huge amount of money if we just slashed the military budget.

If this has been so true for so long, and it's obvious that anybody can see it, then why does nobody serious do anything about it? There's lots of people who are interested in cutting spending elsewhere in the budget. Why not the military too, if so much of it is unimportant? Why are the people who are most knowledgeable and connected to the problem not all singing the same tune?

For one, what do you think Sanders actually wants to cut? It's always ambiguous. He has no idea what specific thing should lose funding---just *the military*, in general. It turns out this is a difficult thing to translate into any clear action. I don't believe he ever identifies what spending of theirs is actually wasteful. Neither does anybody else. Here's my leading hypothesis for why that is: the military generally isn't very wasteful. It's just expensive. There must be *some* waste---because it's a huge, decentralized organization that operates all over the planet---but there's not just a bunch of extra money in the budget that you could squeeze them for.

What about that part where the US military "fails an audit"? That keeps making headlines, but if you look into it, it doesn't really mean what you might think. The picture that Sanders wants to paint is the government gives the military billions of dollars, then a year later we ask them "hey, where did all that money go?", and the military says "we literally don't know, it all vanished". The implication is they gave it away to all their rich friends, or blew it all on cocaine or something.

The military didn't used to audit itself in the way it's currently attempting. This audit being a requirement is relatively new. The US military has a yearly budget of around 800 billion dollars, and it owns trillions of dollars of stuff, which is spread all over the world. This 'audit' is actually 29 different sub-audits of various defense department services, involving thousands of auditors visiting god knows how many different facilities trying to assess everything the military touches. So far, every year since this has been requested of them, the military has 'failed' the audit, which means its recordkeeping processes aren't up to standard yet and there's still room for improvement (which they're committed to continue making).

None of what I just wrote would be news to Sanders. He's part of the federal government and has been for decades. He votes on legislation, including bills that pertain to the military. When he says the Pentagon has failed 7 audits and lost track of billions, he's trying to mislead you about what's going on. He wants you to believe the military is just a black hole that money disappears into, and that all the other elected representatives are failing us by choosing to not stand up to this obvious corruption and waste.

This is the problem with independent, 'anti-establishment' candidates who never really get into power and have to be held responsible for things. They can just sit on the sidelines spewing stupid garbage and never really have to deal with the consequences. Ron Paul was terrible for this reason: he knew his ludicrous proposals would never be implemented, so who cares? Just say whatever you want. How liberating it must be to not have to take yourself seriously.

For me, 'military--industrial complex' is a red flag that doesn't guarantee anything, but makes me pause and ask whether I'm currently listening to a moron. Similar caution can be applied for people who talk about MKUltra, or the sinking of the *USS Liberty*, or---for a more pedestrian example---somebody who insists on always weaving Barack Obama's middle name into conversation.
