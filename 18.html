# **Transcripts: context for inflammatory Trump statements**

### ***if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath***

What was this quote about? It comes from [<u>this</u> video](https://youtu.be/XGJwCUHVgc0?t=1880) of a rally in Ohio, March 2024.

||transcript
| *(around 31:20)*
**Trump:** | Let me tell you something, to China, if you're listening, President Xi, and you and I are friends, but he understands the way I deal, those big monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now, and you think you're going to get that, you're going to not hire Americans and you're going to sell the cars to us. No. We're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those cars, if I get elected.
**Trump:** | Now, **if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole...** That's going to be the least of it. **It's going to be a bloodbath for the country.** That'll be the least of it. But they're not going to sell those cars. They're building massive factories.
**Trump:** | A friend of mine, all he does is build car manufacturing plants. He's the biggest in the world. I mean, honestly, I joke about it. He can't walk across the street, in that way he's like Biden. But for building a plant, he can do the greatest plants in the world, right? That's all he cares about.
**Trump:** | I said, "I'd like to see one of your plants." Recently, I said, "I'd like to see. Where can we go?" "Well, we have to travel to Mexico." I said, "Why Mexico?" He said, "Because that's where the big plants are building. China's building really big plants in Mexico and Mexico's building…" "What about here?" "Well, we're building much smaller plants here." Can you believe it? Can you believe it?
| ... *(later, around 40:02)*
**Trump:** | The other does bring back some good memories in all fairness. It's really no wonder that Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us, they only know and you remember this. We're the only ones, and they know this, that can stop them.
**Trump:** | We're the only ones. There's nobody else around. If this election isn't won, I'm not sure that you'll ever have another election in this country. Does that make sense? **I don't think you're going to have another election in this country if we don't win this election.**
**Trump:** | I don't think you're going to have another election or certainly not an election that's meaningful and we better get out or we better... I actually say that the date, remember, this November 5th, I believe it's going to be the most important date in the history of our country.

Answer: no, this one wasn't really that bad.

### ***poisoning the blood of our country***

Did Trump say immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country?

This came from [around 44:15 in <u>this video</u>](https://youtu.be/kFLEmoGEOmg?t=2654) of a rally in New Hampshire, 2023-12-16.

||transcript
**Trump:** | I had a great life. I had a life of tremendous luxury. I built a tremendous company. You actually got to see that with this fake trial I have going on in New York. Tremendous cash, very low debt, greatest assets, very few people have assets. And I could've been all over the world sampling my assets. And instead, I'm in New Hampshire with you and I'm very happy about that. I'm very happy. But they asked me, a lot of times I get asked this question, "Sir, you had the greatest life anybody could have, would you do it again?" I said, "Absolutely." I'm so honored to do it, because we made America great and then they've destroyed our country. And we're going to make it great again, greater than ever before, and there's nothing I can do that's going to top that.
**Trump:** | I've had plenty of the other life, right? We've had plenty of the other life. We got a lot of work to do. When they let---I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country---when they do that, we got a lot of work to do. **They're poisoning the blood of our country.** That's what they've done. They poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world, not just in South America, not just the three or four countries that we think about, but all over the world. They're coming into our country, from Africa, from Asia, all over the world. They're pouring into our country. Nobody's even looking at them. They just come in. The crime is going to be tremendous.

Answer: yeah, this one was pretty bad.

### ***very fine people on both sides***

Did Trump watch a Nazi rally and say there were very fine people on both sides?

It originates from [<u>this</u> presser Trump held](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGKbFA7HW-U) on 2017-08-15, right after the [Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally).

||transcript
**REPORTER:** | Do you think what you call the alt left is the same as neo-Nazis?
**TRUMP:** | Those people -- all of those people, excuse me -- I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups, but **not all of those people were neo-Nazis**, believe me. **Not all of those people were white supremacists** by any stretch. ... **Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue [of] Robert E. Lee.** ... This week, it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? ...
 | *... [reporters then ask about other topics, before one brings it up again] ...*
**REPORTER:** | The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville.
**TRUMP:** | Excuse me, they didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you **also had people that were very fine people on both sides**. You had people in that group---.... I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
**REPORTER:** | George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.
**TRUMP:** | George Washington was a slave owner. ... So will George Washington now lose his status? ... How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay, good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? It's fine, you're changing history, you're changing culture, and you had people -- and **I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally -- but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists**, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
**REPORTER:** | I just didn't understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?
**TRUMP:** | No, no.

Answer: kind of, but not really? It was a pretty bad answer for other reasons, but he wasn't referring to the Nazis when he said 'fine people'. (I talk about this more in [this post](24.html).)
