# Relationships |2024-12-14

This is more personal than what I usually post here. The overarching theme is my own personal difficulties with relationships. Writing this all out is what I've decided to do instead of continuing to pursue therapy, which I've tried but which hasn't been helpful for me.

### Insecurities with men

They say children are like little sponges: they absorb everything around them. They watch, they listen, they learn. That's how you form your ideas about the world. It comes from your environment, the people around you as you grow up. The ideas, themes, or attitudes I absorbed left me feeling rather insecure about myself as a person around men, but not around women. As a woman who's cursed to be attracted to men, this has been a significant problem throughout my adult life, and one that I've still yet to overcome.

I feel that men are valued for their capabilities and for what they do. A man is strong, intelligent, he's a good leader, a builder, he fixes things, he solves problems, he protects you, he's assertive, driven, he makes money, and he's funny. Then his wife enters the room, and he introduces her: "Everyone, this is my beautiful wife." What does she do, I wonder? He's a high-level executive at the company. She looks nice. There's always a difference in what things we emphasize and compliment in men and women, and in how women talk about men they like versus how men talk about women they like. It all accumulates in your mind, and you eventually develop a natural sense of what things are valuable to people and what things aren't. And the sense I have is that what men value about women is... well, not much.

It took me a long time before I realized men don't care if you're smart. For most men, it's basically not even a factor. They might be annoyed if you're *especially* stupid, but only if you're unreasonable and it causes them a hassle. A girl who's dumb, but shuts up and does what you tell her? For most guys, that's fine. But being any smarter than average doesn't score you extra points. In fact, if you're *too* clever, it works against you, because that might threaten some guys and make them feel insecure about their own intelligence and relative standing. Just as men prefer being taller than women, so they like feeling better than women in most other ways too. They want women to look up to them, and not only literally. It would be embarrassing, emasculating, if a man's wife knows more than he does about cars, or if she could lift heavier weights than him, or if she were a stronger swimmer, or if she were better at math, or whatever.

The only areas in which men are comfortable with their wives out-performing them are those considered to be *women's things*, in which men don't even consider theirselves to be competitors---e.g. raising children, cooking dinner, doing household chores, putting on makeup. And even when it comes to those things, men don't believe women are naturally advantaged so much as they're more practiced, because these are the things women have been relegated to. It's the stuff men don't want to bother with, so instead they have women do it. The average man assumes he could out-do his wife at any of her own duties, if he really put his mind to it. That's why all the top chefs in the world are men, as he's happy to point out. But he doesn't *want* to out-do her at those things, because what is he, gay or something? Why would he want to be good at *women's* things? That stuff is for girls.

The two main things men want from women, aside from being at least functionally competent and sociable, is that you're attractive and you can have babies. That's why women are forced to care far more about their youth and beauty, for these two things are the only currency for male affection. This is why generations ago, most people only had same-gender friend groups. A man would have a circle of male friends, then go home to his wife or girlfriend, and vice versa---girls would have a circle of female friends, then go home to their husband or boyfriend. In most circumstances, the only reason men bother being around women is to find the one they'll end up having sex with. If that's not the category you're applying for, then from a man's perspective, what's the point of you? Why interact with you at all, when instead he could just go hang out with his male friends, who he perceives as better, more interesting, and more likely to share his hobbies and interests? It's a serious conundrum. I've heard numerous men throughout my life say "if we didn't want to have sex with them, what would be the point of women?" It's played as a joke, after a moment or two, but it's one that betrays their real feelings.

This is why the concept of 'the friend zone' even exists for men to complain about: for them, the whole point of interacting with women is sex, ergo a woman with whom sex isn't an option feels like a scam, a rip-off, a waste of time---especially if they began interacting with her thinking sex *was* on the table and only learn afterwards it's not.

It's a completely different story interacting with women. All of this judgment, doubt, fear, and insecurity fades away; suddenly the non-sexual aspects of myself actually matter, and could have value to somebody, because women perceive me and interact with me in a completely different way. Around women I feel like myself; around men I feel unattractive and worthless.

I could attempt to cope with the situation by giving up and swearing off men, concluding they're just not for me, but that doesn't feel sufficient or satisfying. It *frustrates* me that this is how things are. It frustrates me that I can't stop myself from feeling this way. I wish it could be better. It's a problem that I wish could actually be solved.

### Whores and madonnas

The term *madonnaâ€“whore complex* comes from psychoanalysis. I occasionally see people say it's also known as the madonna--mistress complex, but it's called the madonna--whore complex first and foremost in every reference or resource so I've ever seen, so that name is the one that's most recognizable, even though madonna--mistress complex makes more sense for what it's describing. A whore is somebody who sells sex, right? Whoever first named this thing the madonna-whore complex was using whore in a more colloquial way. Really they just meant, like, slutty.

In this context, the word 'madonna' has nothing to do with the pop singer. It comes from the Italian for 'my lady', which for a long time was another way of referring to the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus---which isn't what the pop singer named herself after; Madonna was literally just her birth name, because Italians families also do that. I don't capitalize the word 'madonna' in this context, because we're no longer using it as a proper noun for a specific person. I'd capitalize it if we're talking about Madonna the pop singer or Madonna the Jesus-mother.

The madonna--whore complex came about to explain why some people end up in sexless marriages, where they still love their wives and have a sexual desire for women, but not a sexual desire for their wives. It's not a general truth or a description of something found in all men, but a specific pattern of behaviour that *some* men exhibit. They come to view women *either* as saintly madonnas (good, respectable, sacred) *or* as debated whores (sinful, profane, irresponsible, but sexually exciting). Normally, you can just be both; the complex describes a man who is for some reason incapable of seeing both in the same woman. Why? I don't know. It's weird. There are some characters in media that seem to exhibit this tendency, and many writers have consciously written pairs of female characters to represent idealizations of the two archetypes for a male character to choose between.

But what interests me isn't the actual psychological complex, if that's even a real thing, so much as the implied spectrum in what men find valuable about women. Even though men don't have to choose between them, 'the madonna' and 'the whore' are personifications of the two main functions that men want women to fulfil: the ideal sex-partner and the ideal mother-figure.

Part of the reason so many transsexual women lean into being overtly sexual is because of their male upbringing and socialization, i.e. their *lack* of female socialization, which emphasizes the importance of sexual repression and caution in partner selection. Early trans women---i.e. trans women who didn't transition that long ago--may act more like gay men, because only last year they practically *were* gay men. But even among the more traditional and female-conforming trans women, who are in most other ways trying to fit in, many people have observed that trans women seem to embrace being really slutty and sexually open at a far higher rate than cis women. I'm not certain this is really the case on average, or if it's not a media-driven perception, but my personal experience, and that of people I know who have experience with the trans community, suggests the former. I do think it's true on average. And for many people, "oh right, because they used to be guys!" is a satisfactory explanation for what could be perceived as a more male-coded sexuality, i.e. being slutty and horny and raunchy. That's usually a male thing. That's probably especially true if we're talking about a pre- or early-transition trans girl you see on the internet who's like 18--22 being horny on main, but what about the majority of us, who are significantly older, been around longer, and just trying to exist?

For this section, my thesis is there's another, less-obvious reason for us being more likely to be all slutty and sexualized, and one that I'd bet is far more significant to that effect overall, which is that trans women are acting, consciously or subconsciously, within the madonna--whore paradigm.

We know that men who are looking for saintly madonnas to bring home to their parents and settle down and start families with are going to look past us. And not only because we're incapable of having children with them, but also because for a lot of society, dating a trans women is still going to be considered weird, so there's a good chance the man himself isn't interested, but even if you are, your parents and grandparents might not like it. And your buddies at work might call you gay. There's a lot of social cost you have to endure, and for many guys, we're not worth it. This leaves us feeling like the only way to feel desirable is to provide sexual attention---since we can't be madonnas, we may as well fully lean into what we can do. Specialize in what you're good at. But even there, most men are less interested in us than in cis women. So out of desperation---in order to 'compete' in the 'sexual marketplace'---we undercut our competitors by having lower prices. In other words, we're easier, more open, more accessible, we let you skip the song and dance of courtship and just sleep with us. We become all slutty. There's a similar stereotype about how ugly or fat girls are more likely to be easy, because they know they have to be. There's a depressing truth to some of this.

It probably comes from the other direction too, where a guy who's okay with trans women is probably going to be less traditional and therefore be less offput by a woman being slutty. In a traditional setting, women being slutty is an indication they're lower-value as a long-term partner, or doesn't have good values, or wasn't raised right, or something like that. This affects women's behaviour: they don't want to be judged negatively and seen as low-value, ergo they avoid slutty behaviour and make men work for it. It's kind of like how if a product is really cheap, you assume it's worse than the expensive stuff. A good woman is supposed to be hard to get. The crude logic is that if you're willing to sleep with me, as a trans woman, then you probably don't care that much about the traditional rules of engagement, so I don't incur as high a cost for being slutty. If there are any traditional men in the room, they might judge me more harshly, but they're the ones who wouldn't have wanted me anyway.

Whether that reasoning is actually true or if that's really how things play out, I don't know.

### Atypical romance

In modern times, the way a relationship works is that both people make an indefinite, exclusive commitment to engage in a number of important changes together: **emotional changes** (affection, trust, openness, great value on each other's approval), **physical changes** (sex, nudity, physical closeness), and **situational changes** (cohabitation, financial entanglement, shared property).

The main reason people agree to an arrangement like this is they experience a romantic love-affliction. Long ago, the driving force to form relationships was financial security and familial stability, but these days everything has been love-ified, so chasing good feelings is now the main thing people care about. And love is a complicated beast, because it's not something you enter into voluntarily or by choice. It just happens to you, whether you like it or not---and it's difficult to terminate if you no longer want it. This is why we compare love with a sickness, because in many ways it's similar to one.

In addition to an obsessive, burning desire for your target, the experience of love is mostly characterized by the presence of various pain-threats that befall you if you don't get what you want from them. If they don't love you back, that hurts, and if you're both in love but can't be together, that hurts, and if you form a relationship but they cheat on you, that hurts, and so on. And we've come up with various names or phrases to distinguish between them, e.g. unrequited.

If you want to be in a relationship, people expect you to feel love. Love is considered the necessary justification for bothering with the relationship, the spark that makes doing all of this worthwhile. If a person found out their partner didn't really love them, that would be painful, even if their partner agreed to continue the relationship despite this. We don't just want our target to go through the motions of a relationship *as though* they're in love; we want them to really feel it. That's where I can run into issues, because I don't experience the same pain-threats as other people, and as a result I don't exhibit all the typical behaviours that people are looking for, and may come off as though I'm not feeling the right feelings.

I didn't know it about myself at first, because you don't know what love is when you're young, beyond *liking someone a whole lot*. Eventually I met somebody who unlocked something in me and I had to go through the typical ordeal: the burning obsession, the power it has over you. And then, as it turned out, they didn't love me back. They only saw me as a friend. The spark I felt for them, they did not feel for me. For many people, that would've been a horrible experience that ruins our friendship and drives me to divorce myself from them entirely---but instead, I felt fine. Nor did it bother me when they later ended up in a relationship with somebody else. I didn't feel a hint of resentment toward their partner. I rather liked them, actually, and I sincerely wished the best for them together.

Later still, I realized I also didn't care if the person I love is sexually intimate with somebody else. Not necessarily, at least. Perhaps it'd bother me if they were sleeping with somebody I hate, but it wasn't a rule in my mind. I don't know why that doesn't bother me. It just doesn't. These are two significant pain-threats that other people in my life go through, but to which I seemed totally immune. I was a mere spectator to their sorrow. I'm not wholly impervious to hurt feelings, though. I could be affected if I feel I've lost somebody, or that I lost their trust or intimacy. I felt a terrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach the times I'd found out somebody very close to me had been lying to me about something, after I thought we trusted each other. I could also feel envy, if somebody rejected me but pursued somebody I felt inferior to. So it's not that I had no pain-threats. I just didn't have the same pain-threats as others.

I went through a phase of wondering if I should call myself *aromantic* or some other neologism, to express how disconnected I felt while listening to everybody else's love-related problems. But that word looks like it should mean a lack of love entirely. I have a difficult time not thinking of what I feel as love. It's just not the *same* love, *the* love, that others go through. Is it so different that it shouldn't be called love at all? I don't know.

I'm also not certain that I even want a standard relationship. I definitely enjoy the emotional and physical changes a relationship entails, but when it comes to situational changes---mixing your life with somebody else's---I hesitate to say it's even desirable. I don't know if I want to live with another person, especially if it's an indefinite commitment. That feels like being stuck or weighed down. And probably creating a lot of problems down the road, if things don't work out. Which they're likely not to.

### Is everything temporary?

There are many things in life we expect to last for a while, but not forever. We apply for and start jobs expecting we'll someday leave them; we move into a new apartment expecting we'll someday move out; we buy a phone or laptop expecting we'll someday get rid of it and buy another. Friendships are sometimes lifelong, but nobody expects you to *promise* they'll turn out to be---and most aren't.

Neither are most relationships. Each time two people come to consider theirselves boyfriend and girlfriend, chances are they're going to break up at some point, not stay together forever until they die of old age. We all understand and accept this in the abstract. When a person asks you out, they're essentially asking: "Would you like to invest some time and energy into each other, as a gamble with a low chance of success, to see if I end up being the one for you?"

Despite the reality of our odds, you're not meant to acknowledge or talk about that, especially with the very person you're gambling with. The expectation is that even though most relationships are indeed temporary, we're supposed to *act*, in each instance, as though *this* is going to be the one that lasts forever. This might be called 'being hopeful', and if your partner *isn't* hopeful, and is instead treating your relationship as though it's going to end in the way that most do, then you're less likely to stick around to see if they're wrong.

This is a realm in which pessimism substantially hinders me. I seem to have some kind of broader psychological complex relating to relationships no less than to everything else. I expect that all people in my life are temporary. I feel no security or stability with anyone I meet. Instead, I have a constant, revolving door of meeting new people while my previous people fade away. It began in childhood for me. The household I was born into moved practically every year, sometimes a year and a half, sometimes eight months. If you have children, please don't do this to them. Instability is terrible for a growing mind. I was always the new kid. I was always learning and navigating an unfamiliar environment. Any friends I made would all get left behind as I packed up to start over in some other city. I never made long-lasting connections and ergo never had to learn how to navigate the complexities of conflict and emotional intimacy that casual, low-stakes acquaintances don't require.

By the time life was more stable in my late teens, a psychological habit and attitude had borned, one that I wasn't aware of and wouldn't analyze or make any effort to overcome until years later. The friends I had when I was 17 were all gone by the time I was 21, and those friends were all gone by the time I was 24, and those friends were all gone by the time I was 28.

I wasn't shy. I could sit down and socialize with strangers well. I made friends with classmates and coworkers. What I didn't do was build on that to transition it into anything more, anything deeper, anything that would last and withstand even a slight change in circumstance. I would quit and change jobs frequently. I moved frequently. In fact, after some point, I realized this was psychological, that I felt some level of need to move around. It felt weird to be in the same place for too long. I'd start thinking to myself, *oh god, I've been in this apartment for almost two years---I should move.*

There are other people who grow up in ever-changing environments, like the children of military members or diplomats, or any career like this that demands parents moving about. I'm given to understand that families in such circumstances try and network with one another for their children's sake, and hopefully compensate with an active home life. Their parents and siblings can provide a sense of stability. For me, this did not happen. I grew up in an environment that I'd describe, for the most part, as emotionally vacant. I was materially taken care of---there was always shelter, food, and warmth, and I never felt unsafe---but nor did I feel known, or loved, or particularly close with anybody. We didn't talk much. I practically never opened up to anyone. I didn't consult anybody for help or advice or comfort. When I had problems, I just tried to be alone, so as to not bother anyone.

By adulthood, I'd grown into a rock. I had no close friends, but moreover I didn't even realize I had no close friends, because I didn't think about it. I wasn't aware of what was missing. I didn't realize there was a problem. I had no expectations, and if anybody formed expectations of me then I probably let them down. I engaged in socialization, but it was a faÃ§ade. I was, fundamentally, a lonely person.

I probably have something called avoidant personality disorder (AvPD). That's not according to a therapist or anything. I've just read about it, and every aspect of it sounds like if somebody just followed me around and described all the things I do. Which is interesting because that makes me think oh, great, there are other people out there plagued with the same nonsense.

* feelings of inadequacy or inferiority, the feeling that one is socially undesirable
* sensitivity to negative evaluation and rejection, leading to a fear of intimacy, despite an intense desire for it
* social inhibition, overreliance on avoidance as a maladaptive coping method
* avoids becoming involved with others unless certain they won't be rejected, and may preÃ«mptively abandon relationships due to fear of rejection by other party (whether that risk is real or imagined)

This makes *friendship* challenging enough as is---now think about how completely fucked I am when it comes to relationships. The very notion that another person would even want a relationship is very difficult to entertain. I don't see why anybody would. There's a level on which I don't believe it. It feels like a fiction, a lie that we're all telling ourselves. I'm like the child at the end of *The Emperor's New Clothes*, the one person willing to not go along with the shared delusion that is this fucking ritual. It's like, oh, you love me and want to be with me forever? No you don't, shut up, that's just something people *say*. Maybe you want to have sex. Yeah, that's believable. And maybe, if we're very lucky, you also want to be friends---but hey, friendship is hard, so I don't expect you to stick around, no hard feelings. (Other feelings, maybe, but not 'hard' feelings. I guess anger at somebody is hard, but sadness is soft? How do we decide what physical sensation emotions feel like?)

### Fear of loss

As an adult, comparing my upbringing with other people's recollection of theirs, I realize that one advantage I was dealt is how I never felt threatened by or unsafe around any of the adults in my life. It seems like beating your kids as punishment was still relatively common for my generation, maybe not most people but enough that it's within the realm of normality; and even people whose parents never actually hit them were more often *threatened* with violence by angry parents who never delivered on the threat. To me, that still seems terrible: even if your mother didn't beat you, the result was she made you no longer feel safe with her. I don't think you should inflict that fear in children. I once read---I forget where---that when things go wrong and they need help, you want your kids to think "oh shit, I should call my parents"---not "oh shit, I can't let my parents find out". That's stuck with me ever since.

A second advantage I had is I wasn't taught any prejudice. Flawed though my experience was in other ways, the adults around me were all good, loving people, I didn't have much access to mass media, and nobody in our family talked about religion, or politics, or expressed disdain for any particular group of people. That might be why I had an easier time with certain self-realizations. I remember figuring out I was gay, and then figuring out, oh wait, no, it's more like bisexual, and both times it was just a flat realiziation of "oh, there's a word for what I'm feeling", and that was fine with me. In some people that triggers an internal panic followed by 15 years of internal struggle and self-hatred, but nope. *Thanks, non-bigoted family.*

Then I grew up a bit more, and learned not everybody in society is cool. I read about how some families are so against homosexuality they throw their kids out. There are homeless teenagers who became homeless because they were gay and their parents rejected them. That terrified me. What would I do if I were homeless? No idea. But my family wouldn't be like that, right? I don't know. How could I tell? I tried talking with other people, like dumb friends at school, where the stakes were much lower. I can get new friends, obviously, but if you screw things up with your family, that's it. Can't replace them. And the reaction was negative, even where I really didn't expect it to be. That taught me I can't trust my own judgment, and if you expect the best from everyone, sometimes you get burned. Sometimes you need to brace yourself for the bad outcome. So ultimately I decided there was no advantage to explaining myself to people, whereas the downside was unknown, but potentially very high, so the rational thing to do was to just never bother telling anyone.

(In hindsight, I was mistaken: there is a lot of benefit to being open about yourself, especially with people you're close to. I was just ignorant of this when I was young.)

Fast-forward four or five years and I started realizing I was a transsexual. I didn't know the word at the time, but I had various thoughts, feelings, and experiences that all slowly pushed me in the direction of the conscious realization that I wish I'd been born a girl. I think that clicked by the time I was 16, at latest. I had dreams where I was a girl. I always wanted people to think I was feminine. It bothered me that I had to be a male instead. I was jealous of girls. I couldn't explain any of this. It was just in my head constantly, and my mind didn't know what to do with any of it. Then one day I stumbled onto the language of transsexuals and gender dysphoria. I was wearing girls' clothes, playing with makeup and doing my hair, but all in secret. Then at some point, I tried telling someone how I felt, and again the reaction was very negative. I got mocked at school for seeming too feminine for people's tastes. Even teachers back then would make an issue out of it. I got kicked out of class once for wearing a shirt a teacher deemed too girly for me. I wasn't as strong then as I am now, so eventually I broke and resolved to hide, forever. Maybe if I ignore how I feel for long enough, it'll go away.

These were the events that compounded to make me the emotionally broken person I was by my mid twenties. I had a lonely upbringing, was never really open or intimate with anybody, then I had some bad experiences talking about gender and sexuality, and that fed into my pattern of never talking about myself, and that grew to encompass everything. The less I told people some things, the less I wanted to tell them anything, and the longer it went on, the harder it was to break, because it felt too awkward to go back and 'update' who I was with somebody. That required explaining the version of me they thought they knew was a lie, and having to explain what the hell is wrong with me, and then they'd have to go through a 'getting used to it' phase. No, it was much easier to completely abandon a relationship and start again fresh with new people---but then I'd always fuck up with the new people, too.

Family became a curse in this respect, because they were the people you could never start over with, because you couldn't get a new family. They ended up being the very last people I told about anything, if I could help it. At some point, after I'd become more self-aware and was reflecting on all this, it started to sink in just how sad my situation was: these people in my life didn't really know me. They only knew the character I played when I was around them.

### The trials of dating

I've known people who struggle with social anxiety. They had difficulty talking to coworkers or classmates, or asking a store clerk for help with something, or going to a bar and sitting down and talking to strangers. They only interacted with people they already knew and felt comfortable with. In this way, I felt like their opposite, or their inverse, or something. I feel most carefree and comfortable talking to strangers, people who I barely know and have no investment in. There's nothing to lose, or very little to lose. I'm also good at navigating new, unfamiliar environments. Maybe that's my lack-of-stability always-on-the-move lifestyle having one silver lining. I start conversation with people I don't know. If you fuck up, who cares? Laugh about it. There's nothing to lose. The worst case scenario is they walk away. I think what happens for other people is they dwell on it; the stranger walks away thinking you're an idiot, and then you replay that moment in your mind for the next 5 years thinking about what an idiot you were. I'm not plagued by that kind of obsession. Where I sometimes experience great anxiety is the inverse case, where I have got to know somebody, and now as a result of that, I have something to lose.

I'm not an easy person to get along with, after shallow pleasantries. I tend to be a very polarizing person: once you start getting to know me, most people seem to either like me or get pissed off. It's strong emotions in both directions. I also have a pattern of making bad first impressions on people who I'm not engaging in what I anticipate to be a brief, meaningless encounter, like if I talk to somebody in the aisle of a grocery store. That kind of interaction is a performance in both directions; neither of us are acting in the way that we would around our close friends. We're putting on our interacting-with-stranger hats, and those versions of ourselves interact for a minute, and then we're off. In other settings, it's different, because I just don't bother putting on any hats. Then I have to slowly recover from the bad first impression I make.

I think what happens is people don't always get why I say or do certain things, and they try to extrapolate, to fit me into a pattern of their previous experiences, which leads to getting a bunch of things wrong because I don't fit very well into the patterns they're familiar with. Then again, some other people seem to like me instantly, though that's far less common. I imagine that I'm kind of like a flightless bird, or a mammal that lays eggs, or something. It probably makes sense that people misjudge me at first, and they aren't necessarily doing something wrong so much as they're applying a filter that works of the time, just not this time. I'm basing all of this off observation. I don't know if it's true, whatever, go fuck yourself.

Once you find a person you like who likes you, and you get to know each other, now suddenly there's something to lose: not only access to the person you like, but also the time and effort that you both put in to reach that point. This is what I mean by investment. I have something resembling a fear of rejection, because rejection means a loss of your investment---but I also anticipate it, which is a different type of problem. I sometimes feel a lot of anxiety when I'm around my closest friends, because I don't want to fuck up and make them upset, because that will accelerate the process of them leaving my life entirely.

I never feel secure with somebody. I never feel as though we've reached a point where no matter what I say or do, they'll stick around and stand by me. I think anyone could leave---and for all I know, I could be on thin ice with any person at any time. Which effectively means I am. There's an imaginary scale of cost versus benefit that comes from interacting with me. If my cost is too high, it eventually outweighs my benefit, and then people won't bother reaching out anymore. Actually, it doesn't even need to outweigh your benefit. The difference---your benefit minus your cost---can just dip below the benefit offered by other people in their life. If that happens, then whenever they have free time, you're probably not the person they're going to contact. And that's basically how friendships end: they fade away.

A relationship, or rather the song and dance that surrounds exploring people as prospective relationship partners---or, uh, 'dating'---is like a supercharged version of all the worst aspects of friendship. If you talk to somebody and the context is you're only even interacting because you're exploring whether you think you'd date each other, everything is different. It's like you're on trial, under examination. It's a job interview, but worse. And people can be so quick to give up and move onto the next person. It's also a road that, if you go down, leads by design to a high-pressure scenario, because if this person ends up feeling love for you, now they're at risk of great pain if they don't get what they want from you. And if that ends up happening, then you feel like it's your fault. Imagine going in for a job interview, and then if you get the job, your boss says "if you ever quit, I'll cut myself". What the fuck? It's like terrorism. But that's what looking for a relationship is like, except for some reason this is normal to us. It makes me want to warn people away. No, don't do it! Don't fall in love! It's not worth it! I'm not worth it!

Have you used dating apps? The popular ones are only available on phones, which is a red flag they're going to suck. But if you look at a graph of how couples meet, the line representing the percentage of people who meet on the internet has only been going up and up over time, even though they're all terrible and nobody likes them and we all complain about them. But that's what *everyone else* is doing, so you have to do it too. Get fucked, welcome to network effects. I'm like Ariel from the Little Mermaid: I want to be where the people are.

The earliest app like this was Grindr. Well, maybe not *the* earliest, but of all the common ones that you hear about, most of them are newer. The gay one has really stuck around by this point, even though it's kind of slow and has super intrusive advertisements that consume your whole phone for 10 seconds. Holy shit. The reason I mention Grindr is because it has the best format of any dating app I've tried---and being me, I tried them all, just out of curiosity. They're all virtually the same experience now except for Grindr, which is only because it's so old.

The Grindr design is there's an open grid, sorted by how close people are to you, and anyone can instantly talk to anyone else by default, until you indicate you're not interested by blocking them. Every app that came after Grindr switched this around and made it so nobody can talk to each other until both of you have matched each other. We went from open but with a blacklist, to closed but with a whitelist. So now you have to sit there reading through a feed of people one by one, giving them a binary yes-or-no option on whether or not they even get the privilege of speaking to you. This feels awful.

It's somewhat dehumanizing, actually. I feel like I'm flipping through a shopping catalogue of human beings. And it's so harsh: within a few seconds, I'm deciding this guy shouldn't even get the opportunity of talking to me? I feel bad. It makes me just want to swipe right of everybody without even looking. Then at some point, I learned *that's what men do*! Which means if you match with a man, that doesn't guarantee he's even looked at your profile, so sometimes you'd match with somebody, then hours later when he gets to the app, he checks you out for the first time, and then unmatches you.

I went out to a restaurant with a friend recently, and we had to raise our voices to hear each other from across the table. So it feels like our traditional way of doing things has gone to shit, the dating app experience is terrible, and I don't want to do any of this anyway because it's all stressful to begin with and part of my brain is fighting me on the idea that it will even lead anywhere fruitful.

I wonder if one day I'll touch on this part again with a happy update, but I'm not counting on it. Sorry this doesn't end on a high note.
