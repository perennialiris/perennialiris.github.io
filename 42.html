# Journalism and paywalls | 2025-06-26

Some of our most prestigious publications---The Times, The Globe and Mail, The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times---don't let you read anything of theirs at all unless you're a paying subscriber. Many others will sample you a few articles, then require you to pay if you want anything more---The New York Times, The Economist, the New Yorker, The Toronto Star, The Washington Post, Bloomberg News. Last year, Reuters and CNN transitioned to this category as well, putting their articles behind a paywall after a set number of freebies, though for now these two are some of the cheapest options.

It's dearly bothersome that these organizations create so much content, they do so much reporting and analysis and write insightful profiles, and so many people just don't get to read most of it because of this model of monetization. The companies are being given to weigh whether they want more eyes or more money---two factors you'd have thought come hand in hand, in a business where attention was everything. Not so, at least not anymore.

As a result, I see links to articles on these websites circulate across the internet as they come out, and then see people discuss the *headline* in the comment sections, and then bicker about their conflicting opinions and intuitions about whatever that headline implies, because they don't know what else the article says. The impact of what the writer has put together is lost along the way, through the telephone.

A few of these website paywalls are easy to get around by disabling JavaScript---but you probably have relatives who wouldn't even think to try doing that, or know how. And increasingly, sites are figuring out they can prevent that workaround by serving the content differently. Today, many people get around paywalls by using illegal third-party websites, which probably won't be able to operate that way forever. Sadly---and mind you, it's a very contextual sadness---I don't think I know *anybody* who actually pays for a subscription to any of these websites.

The worst outlets you can think of, meanwhile, are probably all available free to charge. If you want to know what the writers at Breitbart or OANN think, they're happy to tell you. They want as many people as possible to read their opinions. As a result of this difference alone, your not-very-political mum looking through her facebook's for-you-page is more likely to read a Breitbart article than anything from, say, the Globe and Mail.

### Why is this how things are, and what can we do about it?

At least one piece of the puzzle is that the bad websites are bankrolled by people who are using them as propaganda outlets. They don't need to be profitable in the traditional manner because some tech or oil billionaire is just paying them to keep the lights on either way, and if things don't work out they can just shut down---they have no great social importance, and ergo there is no legacy that anybody would mourn. It would just be another moneylender at a strip mall closing shop and moving on. Yet on and on they go, for now. It's easy to keep finding new shady investors when you lack journalistic integrity.

Another factor I've been thinking about lately is the **ad-blockers** we're all running. In sufficient number, they kill the potential for serving web traffic to be a reliable revenue stream. If you have one of these extensions, then every time you use anything on the internet that's trying to support itself with ads, you're a free rider: you hopped on the train without buying a ticket, you dined and dashed, you imposed a cost onto the system but didn't give them anything in return. Is a more impoverished information landscape the fruit of our entitled sins?

Yes, there was a time when ads were too intrusive (some of you may not even remember, but they had the power to open theirselves in new windows, thus creating pop-up ads, and that wasn't even the worst of it), the ad delivery networks at times contain scams or links to malware, advertising delivery networks didn't do well enough to police what ads would get served to what customers (if I put ads on my website selling children's toys, do I want "SEXY WOMEN IN UR AREA WANT TO CHAT" in my sidebar?), and so on. But in response, adblocking communities just nuked all ads indiscriminately, and the result was the internet ecosystem was more difficult and more costly for people to build into. Now everything requires public funding, donations, or a paid subscription. Was it worth it?

This is what Google is trying to reverse via their control of the Chrome web browser. They have the power to disable adblocking extensions in the app itself, and the result was many people jumping ship to competitors. If we view this simply as "Google is trying to force me to look at ads that I don't want to see" then it may seem abusive---and indeed self-interested, as Google itself is a major player in advertising. There's another angle to consider, though, which is that if everybody blocked fewer ads, more internet content could be monetized, which means more creatives and more journalists would be able to do what they do, and the result might be an internet that you like better overall.

If that play doesn't work, though---and I'm not saying I want it to, since it *does* also have some serious drawbacks, including Google probably not being a company you should put all your trust in, and the fact not having any adblocker or filtering service *at all* makes the internet more dangerous (if Google was also leading the way in creating a verification and whitelist service for "trusted ads" or some such, this would all feel better)---what can we do in the meantime?

The situation we've ended up in is why publicly-funded media is so valuable. There's never any kind of obstruction to viewing content by public broadcasters like the BBC, CBC, and ABC (the British, Canadian, and Australian Broadcasting Corporations, respectively), which are all owned directly by their respective governments but which enjoy global respect for their editorial independence. There's also PBS and NPR in the United States. In Canada there’s CTV and GlobalNews, which are still available freely. In British journalism there's The Independent and The Guardian, the latter operating effectively (though not officially) as a nonprofit, asking users to contribute in a style reminiscent of Wikipedia. ProPublica and Mother Jones are two more actual nonprofits that are funded by donations and grants and therefore don't employ a paywall. And there is the Associated Press, or the AP, which stands tall and proud in the world of journalism, a non-profit coöperative that focuses on objective, fact-based reporting through a global network of reporters that all remains freely available, and it's probably going to remain so for the foreseeable future. Like Reuters, a share of its revenue comes from licensing its stories to other outlets.

Some websites founded more recently---Axios, Politico, HuffPo---are more likely to be freely available, but I suspect the longer they're around the more likely they are to go the way of the most established publications. The game is they can't shut theirselves off just yet because they're still pursuing growth and trying to become the more dominant, recognized names with the soft power to demand money from loyal readers, and they all still have fresh investor money to burn through trying to make that happen. Axios, for example, was only founded in 2016, has already gone through multiple change-ups, layoffs, and got purchased by a bigger company 2022, and it still barely even feels like a real website---its articles feel more like a few tweets. I haven't seen them be terribly biased or inaccurate, so it doesn't seem bad to take news from them, but I don't know if their current model is sustainable, and if they were to disappear from the internet tomorrow, it wouldn't be too sorely missed.

The other category of news that's remained free is that which is served by enormous media conglomerates which have many different revenue streams to pull from and for whom the profitability of their news division is therefore less crucial than it would be for a company that specializes only there; but it's questionable whether this will remain so indefinitely, or if there's just going to be a lag before they start adopting similar monetization strategies as the newspapers have. For now, though, you have the family of outlets NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC, which are all owned by NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast. There's ABC News, owned by Disney, and Fox News, owned by Fox Corporation. And there's CBS News, which is owned by Paramount. However, CNN, which is owned by Warner Bros., began putting its news articles behind a paywall in 2024, so it's not as though outlets controlled by large conglomerates are guaranteed to remain freely available.

What's now called "sponsored content"---ads appearing directly in the thing you're listening to---has become more common as a way of trying to advertise to you in a way that your adblocker doesn't hide. An interesting benefit here is that when you put ads on your website, there's an ad delivery service like Google's adsense that just loads ads on the page for you dynamically, and you don't know ahead of time what's going to appear, meaning you as the person whose content those ads are funding are sacrificing a portion of control over what your viewers end up seeing. You just know *some* ad will appear in that panel to the right of the article. When a person on YouTube is paid to read an advertisement into their video, or somebody with a podcast on Spotify is paid to read one into their, uh, podcast, they get to know exactly what they're agreeing to and get to control how it's presented. This is a huge implicit quality control, and it allows for the companies trying to advertise their products to build working relationships with the people they're sponsoring.

I sometimes really dislike the ad being part of the video itself, though. To my mind this taints it in some way, like if the characters in a movie took a break and turned toward the screen to tell you about their promoted brand of soft drink. I suppose it depends on the type of video. It can also date the video if you watch it years later, or if you download the video as a file, the ad is still part of it, and even if you purchase a YouTube premium subscription that's supposed to support them directly, well, guess what, you still see the ad segments that are in the videos itself. This might still be a positive development overall, but it's not without anything to complain about.

If you ask me, the most I can do as an individual right now is try and actually support people who produce the things that I value, instead of using workarounds to get onto their website without paying. If you're paying for Netflix or something, then my god, come on, that alone costs more than multiple news subscriptions. Pay for a subscription to the Times, or Reuters, or whatever you're into. Many of these sites also discount the first 6 months or whatever when you sign up. (It's really minor, but if you're in Canada, you can [get a tax credit that reimburses you](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/deductions-credits-expenses/digital-news-subscription/list-qualifying-digital-news-subscriptions.html) for digital news subscriptions to Canadian-owned media companies, including the Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, National Post, the Calgary Herald, and so on.)

No, nobody paid me in any way to make this recommendation.
