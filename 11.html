# The Trump appeal |2024-12-03

What does anybody *like* about Donald Trump? It's a question many people ask theirselves, and no answer comes to mind. But it's something that for me has long seemed obvious. Either I'm wrong or everybody else just doesn't get it. Let's compare answers.

To be sure, Trump is somebody with almost no positive qualities. He's not strong or intelligent, he's not resilient or brave, he's not inventive or aspiring. He has no respect for the law, for his country, for his oath of office. He looks and dresses like a clown. He barely won the presidency and was never popular with the American people. His administration was awash with crime and corruption and incompetence. His presidency was by all means a failure. The greatest myth about Donald Trump is that he's wealthy and successful. He's only wealthy. People don't realize how much he inherited, nor how little he's done with any of it, aside from every now and then trying to do his own thing and failing. If not for his rich father, none of us would have any idea who this person is, because by every measure but his bank account, he's worthless.

And he lies. My goodness, he lies constantly, shamelessly. He doesn't even care that we can tell he's lying. If you prove he's lying, he'll just lie some more. He barely even tries. He's not a clever manipulator. He's not a mastermind. He just has no respect for the truth, so he lies brazenly to your face and expects that nobody is ever going to do anything about it. That probably gives us a small insight into the kind of sad, privileged upbringing he came from.

If all of this is true, then how could such a person have a cult of personality around him? How could such a person maintain a loyal following, such devotion from his followers, through thick and thin? Trump's supporters don't just think he's a competent executive. They downright love the man. It's almost sickening.

## The only honest man in Washington

In the Danish folktale, *The Emperor's New Clothes*, a king is tricked by men who claim to be selling magical robes invisible only to those who are incompetent or stupid. Eventually everybody is playing along, pretending to see robes that aren't there, each person believing they're the only one who can't see them. It takes the innocence of a child to blurt out that the king has no clothes for everybody to realize they've been had.

If you're a politician or public figure, you're expected to be polite and uncontroversial. It's called being politically correct or something. For example, a politician might say "rural folks with little economic and education opportunities", instead of "stupid hick fucks". We try to phrase things sensitively, delicately, to avoid offending your own constituents. There are various notions of things that one should and shouldn't say, if you're trying to have broad appeal and be a uniting leader.

That's what many people are sick of. They see it as a dishonest game that politicians all play together on stage, akin to the people who go along with the lie of the emperor's robes. Trump, then, is the lone truth-teller, somebody who blurts out the truth that we all know, but nobody else is brave enough to say. So often when Trump is criticized for saying something that Mitt Romney would never, it's actually an example of what his supporters consider his best quality.

Trump is, in short, *the guy who says what we're all thinking*. That's his power. That's what people love about him.

Think about his various controversies. Early in his first campaign, people said John McCain was a war hero. Trump challenges this, saying he's just called a war hero because he got captured. If you look into it, that's sort of true. McCain was captured and tortured. He didn't get called a hero because he ran bravely into battle and saved a bunch of people or something. He flew a plane in the Vietnam war, and his plane got shot down at some point and he was taken prisoner for 6 years.

Many people saw this as Trump being a disrespectful jackass. Others viewed it as Trump being defiant, irreverent, not playing into the politically correct game the media wanted him to play. Why does he need to give McCain some kind of deference or respect just because his plane got shot down? A lot of people watching thought to theirselves "hmm, good point actually". They were happy to go along with that war hero narrative in the past, but Trump snapped them out of it by challenging the orthodoxy.

I remember when Trump made headlines by referring to a bunch of poor countries like Haiti as 'shithole countries'. Polite society hissed, but people throughout the rest of society thought "well yeah, I mean, they *are* shithole countries". Trump isn't *wrong*---he's just saying the thing you're *not supposed to* say. How brave! And oh how *honest* of him!

In recent memory, during the 2024 race, Trump said he didn't know Harris was black. He mispronounced her name. It turns out lots of people in the country also thought she was Indian or something, or weren't sure what her ethnicity was, and despite her being vice president for the last four years, a lot of people were also mispronouncing her name. Trump tapped into the stupid zeitgeist. The crowd thinks it, Trump says it. The other politicians and newscaster know-it-alls are drinking their lattes, meanwhile Trump is on stage going "wait, kuh-malla's a black? .. person?"

Trump said he doesn't like paying overtime. Years ago, he said he tries to get out of paying contractors. And he tries to get out of paying taxes as much as possible. For a lot of people, this is stuff all rich people think. Trump is the only one honest enough to say it out loud. So it's actually to his credit that he does. Of course he'd like to pay people less, and pay less taxes. What's the problem, news media? Don't like someone who tells the truth?

Hey, remember when John Dingall died and Trump joked about how he's in hell now? Funny, speaking his mind even when it might be shocking. Do you remember that time he made fun of a disabled reporter? That's right, he doesn't give a shit. Remember all those times he referred to the press as the enemy of the people and called CNN fake news? That's right, he stands up for himself, even when the media doesn't like it. Remember that time he made fun of Chris Christie for being fat (even though he's also fat) and called Ted Cruz's wife ugly? He's not afraid of the establishment politicians. Hey, remember when the *Access Hollywood* tape came out and Trump says he just walks up to women and grabs them because they'll let him if they know you're a big star? That's our Trump---tellin' it like it is.

As soon as you start thinking about it this way, everything clicks into place.

## High class, but low class

Who first said Trump is a poor man's idea of a rich man? No, wait, was it a dumb person's idea of a smart person? No, that can't be right. ... I just looked it up, and apparently the origin is disputed, so whatever. The point is that Trump is, indeed, a special kind of rich person. He's not like those *other* rich people. He's not refined or highly educated, he has no appreciation for art, or really anything deep, meaningful, or challenging. He's tacky, classless, he has no taste. He covers things in gold because he thinks gold is what rich people are supposed to like. His favourite food is McDonalds. He orders his steak well-done and puts ketchup on it. He doesn't use big words. He talks like an idiot. He even *types* like an idiot (or gets other people to type like an idiot for him). Bill Burr once said he likes George Bush because he makes him feel like he could be president too. In the same way, Donald Trump makes people feel like they could be billionaires. Because why not? If this fucking imbecile ended up rich, why not you?

In a twisted way, I think Trump has a mind closer to the working poor than the mind of other billionaires. Think about it like this: if you gave some random truck driver billions of dollars out of the blue, what would they do with it? They might immediately go grocery shopping. Buy a house, a car? Go to the doctor? But after all of those immediate things come to mind, what would their life end up like, if they didn't run out of money? I'm sure some poor people would end up pursuing something spiritually enriching and meaningful, giving to charity, travelling the world, surfing, trying new things, playing with cheetahs or something.

But people who are particularly shallow, with closed minds and no curiosity about the world? They would probably end up a lot like Trump. He basically just lives in hotels and eats fast food and plays golf. His biggest goal for a long time was trying to get himself on television because he wanted attention and fame and recognition. He kept throwing some of his money at business ventures that would fail and were just an excuse to plaster his name on stuff because he wants to feel like he did something. He goes around perving on little girls and married some random trophy-wife model and paid to have sex with porn stars. Every so often he would go on TV and self-importantly ramble about topics he knows nothing about, but some reporter would talk to him like he's important because they know he's rich.

Trump and a lot of random guys in society are on the same wavelength. Trump thinks the way they do. That's why all the stupid, ugly things he blurts out are appealing to them, and they think of him as 'their guy' despite the fact they know he's a billionaire. Because he's kind of like how they'd be if they were billionaires too. He's high class, but he's low class.

I wonder, is the future of politicians just going to be simple-minded people blurting out every dumb thought that comes to mind, hoping to channel the spirit of the masses like how Trump did? Let's pray the answer's no.
