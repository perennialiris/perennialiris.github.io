# Trump and Russia |2025-03-06

Americans used to be resolutely against Russia. They all identified and understood Russia to be an enemy of their interests, a bad actor on the world stage. Many remember the Cold War, and understand the extent to which Russia today still represents the USSR---as the country has fallen back into dictatorship, led by a former KGB agent, and is pushing around its Eastern European neighbours. In 2012, Mitt Romney called Russia "without question, our number one geopolitical foe". Today, everybody can watch as America does Russia's bidding, as America sides with them against Ukraine---but why?

## Theory 1: Blackmail

The details are hazy, but there's a theory that goes like this: Trump works in real estate, in a city full of crime and corruption, so this could've happened as early as the 1980s. He---and possibly Giuliani---at some point got in bed with Russian operatives, who got dirt, if not on both of them then at least on Trump. There have been numerous allegations over the years that Trump represents a potentially major security threat because he is vulnerable to blackmail. He's lived a scandalous life, he pays bribes, he commits various crimes, he engages in strange and embarrassing sexual behaviour. In 2017, an additional **allegation** was that Trump had visited Russia---which we do know to be true---but that while there, he engaged in sexual acts with prostitutes and had them do god knows what.

In 2016, Trump's campaign, including his personal lawyers and family members, met with Russian operatives in his place of residence in hopes of getting dirt on their Democratic Party opponent. Russian hackers targeted the Democratic Party campaign, and published their information on WikiLeaks, which the Trump campaign was also in direct contact with. Trump, once in office, is completely subservient to Russian interests. He gets on stage at Helsinki and claims that he would take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of all his own government's intelligence agencies. He also insists on having numerous one-on-one meetings with Putin that nobody else was ever privy to.

Imagine if it turned out Putin had something on Trump the entire time. He wasn't giving Trump orders, but he made it clear to Trump early on that if he didn't play ball with the Russian agenda, they would release something to make his life hell---and, perhaps also crucially, Trump didn't really see going along with the Russian agenda as that big an ask anyway.

The question is, what could they possibly have on him? What would be enough? His tax returns? Proof of crime? Proof that he cheated on his wife? Nobody would even care about any of that. His supporters would come up with some kind of justification, a whataboutism about some left-winger who did something similar, and forget about it by next week. To be effective, it would have to be crazy bad.

The only thing I can think of would be pedophilia, or a violent rape (not a "he pressured me into it and I froze up" rape, since his followers would all dispute the legitimacy of that and forgive him, but a "she's crying the whole time and he keeps hitting her and telling her to shut up while he moans over her cries" kind of violent fuckfest). What else, short of an extreme possibility like this, would Trump even care about?

## Theory 2: Spite

Trump isn't a successful businessman. He was just born into more money than he's worth, not as a big pile of cash but as an already-functioning real estate empire that constantly brings in money without him having to really do anything. If I had inherited what Trump did, I could be richer than he is today by just sitting on my hands doing nothing. The few times Trump has tried to do something on his own, most of them have failed---you've probably heard about many of them (Trump steaks, Trump university, Trump vodka, Trump whatever). He's a simple man: he thinks his last name sounds cool and manly, so he finds a company that makes a product and pays them to put his name on it. He doesn't actually *do* anything beyond that.

Trump's life changed when he got into doing reality television. As the host of *The Apprentice*, he was able to broadcast a completely make-believe version of himself into Americans' homes: a powerful, successful businessman who made tough decisions with conviction. It was like he was play-acting his personal fantasy, the life that he wanted but never actually had. The show was a hit, and his salary for being the face of it is where a huge portion of Trump's wealth actually came from, not real estate. He's rich like Judge Judy.

Trump wanted to mingle with successful rich people. He wanted to be respected in that community. He never was. He tried, but he was largely rejected by the actual elites---the real billionaires, the ones who actually ran businesses instead of just pretending to on TV. He wished that he could've been somebody like Richard Branson or Michael Bloomberg. Everybody who was anybody saw Trump as a silver-spoon moron who was born into wealth, did nothing with any of it, and talked like somebody who wouldn't be qualified for middle management. They laughed at him, they didn't take him seriously, and he hated them all for it. That's why he became so insecure about his wealth (because that's literally all he has), and why he isolated himself as an 'outsider' up in his big-boy tower, the one with is name on the side in big letters.

Barack Obama angered Trump because he had the admiration and respect that Trump wanted, and Trump didn't think he deserved it. He wasn't even a billionaire! There must be something wrong, something off about him, some disqualifying factor. "He can't have won---he must have cheated!" Trump became a leading voice in the 'birther' movement, trying to disqualify Obama from being president at all. Obama, like the Manhattan billionaires, represented an elite class of American society that Trump wanted to be a part of, but it was a club he couldn't get into. Again, they laughed at him.

Now president, Trump harbours a personal resentment for the American elite and their ideology. He hates American business leaders, he hates American politicians, he hates all the people who ran the show before him. He *was* the loser, but now he's finally getting his revenge---and upsetting the international order is one of the ways that he's doing it. These people, these *career politicians* and *people with actual university degrees* all think Russia is bad? The enemy of Trump's enemy is Trump's friend. If Obama, McCain, and Hillary all didn't like Putin, then maybe Putin isn't so bad.

## Theory 3: Trump's (lack of) values

Most normal people look at the Russia--Ukraine conflict and instantly, obviously understand why Russia is the villain. The only people who don't think so did initially, and needed very strong arguments---or cash bribes---to pull them over into being sympathetic to Russia's twisted narrative. This is something Trump doesn't relate to at all. On some level---not even very deep down, but at least a little bit beneath the surface---Trump doesn't get why he's supposed to be on Ukraine's side. He looks at the Russian--Ukraine war and if it were up to him, he would've joined in on the side of Russia and helped them conquer Ukraine. Why not?

Trump's America doesn't have any real values or virtues. It would probably go around the world and help whichever side in any given conflict is willing to pay America the most, or just back the side that's already winning, in order to never lose. It would stand for nothing aside from its own self-enrichment. Freedom, democracy, peace---to Trump, these are just words that you say into a camera when the teleprompter tells you to. He doesn't care about any of it.

Trump doesn't think Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Il Sung, or any other autocrat are doing something wrong by ruling over their countries undemocratically, suppressing their opposition, curtailing the free press, and surrounding theirselves with yes-men losers who just tell them whatever they want to hear. To Trump, these guys are just getting away with exactly what he wishes he could do here in America. It's not really clear to him why these guys should be his enemy---aside from that all the American elites, whom he hates, act like that's how it ought to be. Trump feels more at home, psychologically, with men like them than around a Western politician who actually governs, actually works with other people in their government, actually cares about their people, and actually follows laws instead of acting like they're above them.
