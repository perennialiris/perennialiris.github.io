# Politics fundamentals

In some ways, I wish that I could describe myself as a conservative. It could have been an apt description of my philosophy and attitude. I support our society as it is, I appreciate our history and values, I tend to be against quick change and prefer gradualism, and I'm skeptical of and resistant to radical and revolutionary movements that aim to change too much too quickly or lack a sufficient appreciation for our core values. However, 'conservative' has, at least in the English-speaking world, been stolen from us, used now for the latest wave of populist, reactionary garbage that's wrapped itself in traditional rhetoric and imagery, like a demon wearing human skin.

To quickly break expectations, I began telling people I'm a transsexual woman, that I'm very glad to live in Canada, and that, if I lived in the United States, I would surely be supporting their Democratic Party. For that matter, I'm not fond of the so-called conservatives in my own country. However, especially in conversation with people who are 'far-left', a certain conservative flavour to my thought definitely comes out. In a sense, I would argue conservatism is centrism, and centrism today should mean resisting the modern right. And for me, this disconnect---between the labels people use the underlying ideas from which those names derived---was all the more reason to emphasize conservative *thought*, to perhaps rescue it from the realm of electoral politics, where a thing *is* whatever it decides to title itself.

For comparison, think somebody identifying as a republican---by which they mean a supporter of republicanism, the idea that we should have a republic. This is markedly different from being a Republican, as in a supporter of the Republican Party in the US today. The two terms may have once been related, sort of, but today they have really nothing to do with each other. So if your goal were to talk about how republicanism is an important idea, you may have to repeatedly clarify "no, I don't mean, the American political party; I mean the idea of republicanism".

It may seem like a losing battle, if not a war already lost, to lay claim to a term against a great sea of people whom I allege are misusing it; but greater shifts in language have happened, and, even if I don't reform society, raising the dispute at least creates opportunity for discussion about the merits of that challenge, and to provide explanation for those interested. It frames what I consider interesting and revelatory conversations, and not only about my own perspective, though here that is the focus.

### What is conservatism?

In the first sense that is often spoken of, conservatism is not directly a political position or platform. It doesn't tell us what you think the government should do or what our laws should be. Rather, it's what I'd describe as a meta-political philosophy. It describes the method or approach by which you decide what things to support. In this sense, a person could loosely be called a conservative in any type of society. In the late Soviet Union, those who wanted to maintain rule by Moscow were sometimes called conservatives in contradistinction to reformists who were fighting for national independence in their respective countries, especially pertaining to the 1991 coup attempt by 'conservative communists' who opposed Gorbachev and Yeltsin. But of course, what kind of society these people wanted is very different from what we mean by conservative normally. This is because they're applying that meta-level attitude to a different society, which by that point had a different constellation of history, values, and institutions. The conservatism we're most interested in is distinctly Western conservatism, which was first articulated in the West and which is the consequence of applying this attitude to Western society. For the rest of this post, when I say conservatism, I mean Western conservatism. I don't have any commitment to *analogues* to our conservatism that we perceive in other societies, which may be seeking to defend a wholly different set of values.

This application gives rise to certain trends, patterns, or currents, which give content to conservatism as a real governing ideology, but whose more specific policy recommendations will naturally be adapted for the time and place that one is attempting to govern. The patterns in question will be familiar to you, things you've heard in broad strokes before: order, merit, hierarchy, skepticism toward radical notions of equality, resistance to movements that try and change too much too quickly, resistance to movements which seek to reform society through an impoverished methodology, a defense of Western liberal values and institutions, including our traditional understanding of liberty and of individual rights.

The stereotype of a conservative has become a person who is all too prim and proper, old-fashioned to a fault, to the point of being lame, stagnant, perhaps even timid in their orthodoxy, too afraid to be different, too repressed to pursue their true desires; clinging, in fear, to what is normal, safe, and familiar. To the contrary, the real history of conservatism has been touched by many eccentric and unorthodox people, brave souls and clear minds. Far from an expression of meekness, to hold fast and defend yourself instead of being swept up by the latest fashionable craze has at many times in our history taken great courage and conviction---to weather the storm that so many of the people around you have succumbed to. Even in my case, though I bear no great risk in my writing, it would surely be easier and likely more profitable if I were to set all conflicting thought aside and simply adopt the most popular slogans of the crowd. I choose not to.

### Beginnings

||image-float
32-1.png|Edmund Burke

Western conservatism took form throughout the 18th century. The person who is by all counts most credited with the development of what we now know as conservative thought is **Edmund Burke** (1729--1797), a British member of Parliament remembered most of all for his [*Reflections on the Revolution in France*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France) (1790). As there's nobody else whose status as a conservative is so unquestioned, a review of his qualities and opinions may help to quickly dispel misconception.

Burke wasn't a blustering patriot who thought his country could do no wrong and opposed all change. He was rather critical of Britain in some respects and, as a politician, actively proposed ways to improve the country through change. He thought it was immoral that Britain participated in the slave trade, for example, and even proposed banning all slaveholders from Parliament. He opposed capital punishment, the norm in his lifetime. He advocated for the rights of groups he thought were mistreated, like the Indians and Irish. Nor did Burke oppose the idea of progress, in either a social or political sense. Rather, he understood that change is necessary for conservation, for, in politics as in so much else of life, that which does not adapt to the ever-changing circumstances life throws our way cannot expect to survive in the long term.

What interested Burke, and what continues to interest conservatives generally, is not attempting to crystalize any given moment in time for all eternity, but pursuing or allowing for only change that comes about through a natural order of events, in a manner sufficiently cautious and gradual, that respects our established traditions and institutions, and which is undertaken with due moral consideration. The meaning of each of these points will be fleshed out throughout this post.

### What are traditions and institutions?

Traditions and institutions are often the focus of praise in conservative writing, and used as a quick summary (often alongside 'history') of those things a country ought to hold dear. But what exactly am I talking about? For many readers, these terms appear vague, lacking any specific content, and in the absence of anything specific 'tradition' is taken as a term for frivolous practices from centuries ago. It brings to mind the outdated table etiquette of a formal dinner party, or an old religious ceremony performed by a man in robes and a funny hat who doesn't believe in birth control, or a practice like colouring eggs on Easter, that obviously isn't *harmful*, but surely nor is it of any great importance for the survival or functioning of civilization. Meanwhile, 'institutions'? Which ones? The government, the corporations? Are we just praising the ruling class? That's likely unappealing for anybody who's unhappy with the general state of things in the country, which these days seems to be at least half the population at any given point.

An **institution** (from the Latin *institutio*, meaning to build, place, begin, or set up) is any organization or establishment people had to put together that comprises the general structure of society. The government, of course, with its many departments and agencies, but also our companies and corporations, our schools and research facilities, our churches, guilds, clubs, unions, our healthcare infrastructure, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, our legal system, courts, the military, the prison system, print and broadcast companies, media infrastructure, studios, art galleries, theatres, museums, libraries, conservatories, the post office, and all the offices and bureaucracy that connects all of these things together and allows them to function as organs of broader society. And then at the base of it all, the traditional household and family structure, in which we all begin our lives. These are the institutions of society, any of which stand to be lost in the event of a revolution whose aim is wiping everything away, as has happened at certain disastrous points in history.

**Tradition** (from the Latin *traditio*, meaning to give, deliver, or hand over) is any belief, norm, convention, or custom that, once established, is passed on between people over time, by one person teaching the next, rather than each of us needing to rediscover it on our own. This is especially associated with intergenerational knowledge (parents teaching things to their children or grandchildren), but even things like one generation of, say, employees at a firm teaching certain rules or practices to new hires, or separate generations of researchers passing on their practices to new students, is all reasonably within what we mean by the traditions of a society. If you have knowledge of any reasonably advanced field, you can probably bring to your mind numerous examples of traditions that exist therewithin. Arguably the concept of tradition can be stretched to include any given social construct, such as language, law, time, or manners.

In the broad sense, tradition includes and is most commonly represented by **cultural tradition**, such as holidays, festivals, rituals, etiquette, clothing, music and dance, food and drink, stories and folklore, art, literature, and architecture. It then also includes more 'serious' or less interchangeable things, like the presumption of innocence, the peaceful transfer of power, equal protection under the law, the rules of succession, ideas about freedom of speech, our attitudes about use of property, or the rules and procedure by which Parliament organizes and operates. Indeed *norms*, from those within a family to the context of business to science to international politics, are a subset of tradition.

#### Cultural tradition isn't frivolous

Some people talk about cultural tradition as though it's frivolous because it's largely interchangeable. Why does it matter for the functioning of society whether people listen to English pop, or Salsa music, or something else? And it's true. If I cherish a teapot, a necklace, and an old military pin, each of them items I've inherited from my grandparents, the reason for their value to me isn't simply their utility, which could be replicated by any items at a store, but for their origin and my personal relationship to that origin. However, it's not important, in any grand sense, which specific teapot my gran bought at that market in 1933. I'd have come to value whichever one she came home with, but this is the one she picked, so now, a near-century later, it's the one I have. But if we could go back in time and have her buy a *different* teapot, and a *different* necklace, and have my grandfather come home with a *different* pin, the present would likely be fundamentally unchanged. The value I place on the teapot, necklace, and pin in this timeline would be likely the same as what I'd come to place on a different teapot, a different necklace, and a different pin in that other version of events.

This is why some people claim that it doesn't matter if a country's culture and demographics change, so long as it only results in the loss of cultural tradition. Society will carry on, just with different clothing, music, food, and so on. They acknowledge the importance of certain political or ethical values, like a free press, but they don't appreciate the important role that culture has in making people identify with and care about their polity in the first place. Sure, it wasn't important in any practical or utilitarian sense which specific food became our national dish, or which style became our traditional dress, and so on---but these things *became* important to us *because* they're ours. It's about the relationship, the connection, the history. And once established as such, these are the things that make our communities feel like home, that motivate us to care about one another and feel invested in our shared future---and be willing to make sacrifice, in the form of restraint and commitment, for the purpose of our shared success. There would be a grand unravelling of political legitimacy and social unity if any country were robbed of the connection between individual and collective, and between current and past generations, that is provided by the landscape of shared cultural experience. I say that our culture is not objectively better than the culture of all other nations, but the fact that *it's ours* means it fulfils a function that nothing foreign could replicate.

### A natural order of events

To speak of a 'natural order of events' may sound like a teleological view of history, as if there were only one, predetermined path for us to go down---but this is not the intention. Rather, it implies a normative *method*, or a way in which societal change ought to come about. Societal change is, in many ways, comparable to the growth of scientific knowledge, or the development of literary or musical traditions in a given culture. We don't know what knowledge future people will discover, but we have opinions about how research ought to be performed and verified, and what attitudes are most appropriate to have toward the knowledge already at your disposal. We don't know what music future people will enjoy nor how they will dress, but we may view a trend that emerges naturally by the choices of free people doing what they enjoy rather differently from one that's mandated by an overbearing state whose leader tells people what their habits must be.

All people know that culture always gradually changes. It improves and refines itself with time, as each new generation of people react to their changing circumstances, or as their experiential knowledge accumulates and they devise new, better ways of solving certain problems. This is why my values aren't identical to those of my parents, whose values weren't identical to those of my grandparents, and so on. Each of us gets to choose how much we adhere to or stray from what we're given as our starting point, depending on how well it fits our own lives. There is no great reason to oppose personal experimentation that's engaged in by people who choose to take on the risk of trying something new, and who stand to bear all the cost if things go awry in their own lives. What is anathema to conservatism is extensive or sweeping change to social rules or institutions, that affect people who are not volunteering for such experimentation, and which find their origin only in hypotheses rather than real, lived experience.

It's important we understand that the status quo of our society was not designed in a lab, nor could it have been. It came about gradually, iteratively, through the lives of all those who came before us. It was their choices and attitudes that gave life to the norms into which you and I are born. And now those things are passed down to us, that we may pick up from where they left off. And there are certain responsibilities in that. We are not merely recipients of a gift. We are meant to carry on as its good stewards, with hope that we may someday do likewise and pass it down to those after us. We are but one node in a sequence, one link in the chain, one part of a grand, multi-generational project that is our society. This framing affords great perspective about the world and one's place within it.

In deciding how to proceed, we begin not from a vacuum of theory nor the dawn of history, but from the reality of our own lives. The status quo is what we have to work with, and as such it's the only real starting point whether we like it or not. It doesn't make sense to treat it as though something that must be justified or argued for, as though it were still a proposal we may ponder and either accept or reject. It already *is*---the pondering stage is behind us now. What matters is where we go from here. This is why we say **it is change that must justify itself to the status quo, not the other way around**. If you have no justification to do anything, then you default to doing nothing, i.e. you carry on as you were before.

Of the many analogies available, I prefer to think of a society like a grand ship, alone at sea. It may go in any direction, so if you have a proposal, then very well, step up and make your case---but remember that travel is expensive, and it can take us a while to turn around if you change your mind or head off in the wrong direction, and if we run into anything the consequences will be dire. And last but not least, it would be quite nonsensical to demand I justify travelling *to* the location where you *already are*.

Still, I encounter people whose method of arguing against an existing thing is not by arguing *for* an alternative to replace it which they reason would be an improve, nor even for how the simple dissolution of the thing would benefit us, but instead by demanding I argue *for* that thing in the first place---as though it did not already exist, and our goal were to establish it as something new. An example I encountered recently was a person who suggested the state should not offer any benefit or recognition of marriage. I asked why not, and their response was asking me to justify why it benefits us to have this recognition in the first place. That's not my job to answer, and the fact he thought it was indicates a defect in his thinking. This would imply the default position, *until you're persuaded otherwise*, is to abolish any given thing that you examine.

32-2.png|G. K. Chesterton|The G. K. stands for Gilbert Keith

It was to counteract this very mindset the British writer **G. K. Chesterton** (1874--1936) long ago wrote what has come to be known as *Chesterton's fence*, which neatly encapsulates much of the conservative attitude:

||indent
"In the matter of reforming things,… there is one plain and simple principle…. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.' … There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease. But the truth is that nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served."
 
--- G. K. Chesterton, from *The Thing: Why I am a Catholic* (1929)

In many areas of life, the attitude expressed here by Chesterton comes to us as 'common sense'. Imagine going to a factory and, with no knowledge of any of the tools or machinery around you, declaring that as it's unclear to you what a given object does, it must be safe to get rid of it. Is that how anything in life works?

A fence isn't a natural feature like a rock or tree. If there's a fence in the road, somebody must have put it there. They presumably had a reason. If we don't know their reason, it becomes harder to say whether it's no longer needed, because we don't even know what criteria to be testing for. Perhaps the fence was built a century ago to enforce a boundary of private property that is no more, and so it's exceeded its usefulness; but then perhaps it was built for reasons that are still important, but that importance is not apparent at this moment---e.g. it's useful only in the winter, or only when local sheep come into town, or some other condition that is not currently met, but will be again.

Sometimes if you remove a thing, only *afterwards* does its purpose become clear, and by then it may be too late to easily recover and we may have a serious problem on our hands. This all becomes especially pertinent when faced with the possibility of revolution.

### Revolutions

Ideally, revolutions would never happen, and it obviously is the goal of any state to prevent them. But the best way to prevent revolutions isn't brutal crackdown against revolutionaries after they've begun organizing. It's to prevent them from forming in the first place by being compromising and responsive, to address the people's grievances, and to allow for responsible changes to be made. A revolution occurs only as a last resort, when the state and its people have become too misaligned for a conventional, peaceful, resolution of their differences. This tends to happen only after pressure has been building up for many years, while the state holds fast and refuses to hear its people's demands.

The most consequential revolution in history was the **French Revolution** of 1789. It wasn't a swift movement, but a process that took multiple years and had numerous identifiable phases, with the infamous decapitation of the French King not happening until 1793. Edmund Burke received updates about it as the events unfolded, and became apprehensive earlier than most. In Britain, the [Glorious Revolution of 1688](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution)---the deposition of the Catholic James II by his daughter Mary II and her husband, the Protestant William of Orange---lingered in the collective consciousness as a *justified* act of the people that led to the (English) Bill of Rights and confirmed the primacy of the English Parliament over the Crown.

32-3.png|Execution at the place of the revolution|"Une Exécution capitale, place de la Révolution" by Pierre-Antoine Demachy

For Britons receiving news about a declaration of the universal rights of man being published by French rebels against Louis XVI, an absolutist Catholic, it was very easy to compare these two events favourably, and to cheer on the rebels. Not breaking from his contemporaries' positive view of the Glorious Revolution, Burke sought to explain his opposition to the French by making a distinction between these two events. To that end, his *Reflections on the Revolutions in France* was published in early 1790, condemning the revolution, still years *before* the Reign of Terror, already predicting the situation taking a turn for the worse. Burke went down as the Revolution's most noteworthy critic---while *Reflections* had a lasting impact on British conservatism and political thought in general.

The American and English revolutions were, for comparison, shaped by their participants' belief in the common law, the ancient rights and privileges fleshed out over centuries by the trial and error of their ancestors. Neither movement sought to will into being some new social order from their imagination so much as to restore the balance of things and protect that which had already been long understood and respected. (Burke could all but support American independence; instead he argued Britain should meet the colonists' demands, allow them to elect their own representatives, and make peace.) In France, however, opposition to the government was not being made with respect to long-standing custom or duty (e.g. "the King has failed his duty to the people", or "the King has committed great crimes against his nation"). Their project was not the will of the French people, nor the natural progression of French history, nor a righting of wrongs and a return to normality. Instead, the only thing being articulated was the radical philosophy of what Burke called a "literary cabal" of revolutionaries. Their perspective was not grounded in history and practical experience, but in abstract theory and ideals they wanted to impose on the nation. There was, moreover, a lack of appreciation for the role of France's own institutions in social stability.

A century later, much of this critique would be repeated by conservatives about the **October Revolution** in Russia. That country had fallen into a period of instability and revolt, but in early 1917 it seemed things may take a turn for the better when Tsar Nicholas II abdicated his throne and the Russian Constituent Assembly was to organize democratic elections. The most extreme faction of Russian society at the time, the Bolshevik party, [participated in those elections, and lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Russian_Constituent_Assembly_election)---and so, resorted to using its paramilitary group, known as the Red Guard, to take power by force, dismantle the burgeoning Russian democracy, murder all their opposition, and outlaw opposition parties. They ruled Russia as a one-party state for the next 70 years.

This was not the will of the Russian people nor the natural progression of Russian society. It was another "literary cabal" come to impose its radical philosophy onto a population unwilling. The vast majority of people were not communists and they did not ask for the revolution the Bolsheviks imposed on them, but nor did that matter.

The result, in both the Russian and French cases, was years of widespread repression and terrorism against anybody viewed as the enemy of the revolutionaries, clinging to their newfound power. In France, revolutionaries made a spectacle of gruesome public executions, not sparing innocent women and children. In Russia, Communists burned, boiled, and otherwise tortured their opposition alive, hoping to make any normal person in the country too afraid to oppose the new regime. Neither group observed the presumption of innocence or due process; they were paranoid, viciously authoritarian, intolerant, and uncompromising. And to this day, there are people among us in Western society who view them positively, and defend all of these actions.

A 'good' revolution is a course-correction against tyranny---something you hope doesn't need to happen, but unfortunately may sometimes be necessary. It's like political chemotherapy. Bad revolutions, on the other hand---which are far more numerous in history---cause us to veer off-course, *into* the jaws of tyranny. This occurs when a new authority installed by revolution feels threatened, unstable, and so to exist at all they resort to lashing out against any and all dissent. This is a gamble: if they're still in control when the dust settles, things will eventually restabilize and they may regain legitimacy. If they lose, they all die. In a sense, the high stakes of the situation make brutality inevitable.

^Notes:

^1. I define a revolution to be any time some group circumvents the established procedure of government to install a new authority by means the system didn't allow for. This is not inherently good or bad.
2. A revolution may vary not only morally but by the quantity of what is changed, or by the extent of the resulting institutional overhaul---from the abolition of all norms, laws, property, and so on, to begin anew from scratch (e.g. the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, the Chinese Communist Revolution, the Haitian Revolution of 1791, the Khmer Rouge victory in the Cambodian Civil War), to a simpler coup d'état where the general structure of society remains largely intact, but carries on with new leadership (e.g. the Glorious Revolution, Mussolini's March on Rome, the American Revolution, the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War). These are called revolutions all the same, insofar as they fit the above criteria.
3. Predictably, people of a more conservative disposition tend to have less favourable views of revolutions the more they change at once.

### Legitimacy

What made Louis XIV the King of France? If you asked him, Louis himself may have said his reign was justified by his *divine right*---but we all know that no god was coming down to fight Louis's battles nor enforce his words. Louis was king only because when he gave his orders, the men under him chose to obey. In a way, that's the only real power any ruler has. But why *do* men at arms commit to obey the leaders they do? Why Louis, and not somebody else? The answer lies in their own perception: that Louis is  not some random brute ordering them around by threat of force, but the *legitimate* ruler of France, a person who is legitimized by the great body of French tradition and custom. They *believe* him to be king *before* their obedience makes him so in fact. Here, as in so much of society, reality is determined by people's actions, and their actions are informed by their beliefs. There is no getting around it.

In the 21st Century, the conventional account of legitimacy has become to say it derives from 'consent of the governed'. Here, 'consent' is taken to mean the public generally accepting and coöperating with a given system---more specifically, by their voting for whatever party ends up in power. This view only kicks the can down the road: if legitimacy means consent, then what makes consent? In a sense, these two questions appear to be asking the same thing. To credit legitimacy to consent also implies a certain (theoretical) order of events: (1) a state presents itself to the people, (2) the people decide whether they consent to it, and (3) if they *do* consent, only *then* the state is legitimate.

This raises further questions---for which there are answers, but not good answers. It's far more clarifying to think of this relationship as the other way around: **consent doesn't *create* legitimacy; it's a *response* to legitimacy**. That is, people tend to accept and coöperate with (or 'consent to') authority they consider legitimate. This returns us to the initial question: what *is* legitimacy? It's that which causes consent, or acceptance and coöperation, or: the perception of those qualities which cause people to respect a claim of authority. What those qualities are can then be observed, albeit only generalized.

1. There is a minimal utility threshold that must be met. In any society, people want safety, stability, and prosperity, and the role of government in securing these things is to effectively maintain law and order. People are generally willing to go along with a system that achieves this and will eventually lose faith in one that does not. This is usually trivially attainable, so it often is not even spoken of, and instead focus can be given wholly to the next two points.
2. There is a feeling of genuine connection---that it's not only some government but *our* government (compare: *our* parents, *our* family, *our* community). A political community is necessarily one of shared identity, the speaking into being a real group of which you consider yourself a member. The British philosopher Roger Scruton (1944--2020) articulated this when he said "the language of politics is spoken in the first-person plural": *we*, *us*, *ours*. We fight for what is ours, not for something alien or foreign to us, or something imposed onto us from elsewhere. Monarchy and democracy are both strategies that help us ground this feeling of connection between polity and the underlying social order---one through tradition, history, and lineage, the other through direct action and participation.
This is why even if the party you support loses the election, you accept the results and consider the winning party to be our rightful government. It's also why people in other countries don't vote in our elections. Why would they? They're not one of us. It's *our* democracy, not theirs.
3. Third is procedure. How do we know what sort of government will be successful going into the future? We offload that question to various heuristics, the main one being compliance with established custom and tradition. For us that means the rules of our parliamentary democracy. We trust our way of doing things leads to effective leadership, ergo if a party has followed the rules, or played the game correctly, they have *earned* legitimacy in our eyes. The required procedure can vary substantially between populations, and between time periods within the same population. In the age of monarchy, the rules of inheritance was the most necessary procedure. In some places, it could be religious rites, or honouring of the village elders. What's important is that which is *established* in society.

In summary, when we describe a government as *the legitimate authority of such and such*, this tends to mean it's truly of the population it claims to represent, that it's gone through the necessary procedure---whatever that may be for the population in question---and of course, it implies that society hasn't totally collapsed, resulting in their people losing faith in them.

## Liberty and liberalism

To speak of *tyranny* as I do throughout the above implies a concept of liberty---i.e. a standard of what must be abridged for us to condemn something as tyrannical. **Freedom**, **rights**, and **liberty** are all easy words to rally behind. They have a universally positive connotation. After all, who doesn't love having freedom? The rhetorical power of these terms, however, lies not only in their intuitive appeal, but in their convenient ambiguity: what they abstract *away*. Any time somebody uses the term 'freedom', ask yourself: freedom *for whom*, and *to do what*? Or *from* what? What are we talking about?

You can't be an advocate for freedom *in and of itself*, or speak of a 'general' freedom without any qualification. All freedom comes at the price, including the negation of other, competing freedoms. We must weigh your freedom to shout against my freedom from loud noise, your freedom to criticize against my freedom from insult or offense, your freedom to kill against my freedom from being killed. It's not enough to say we should choose the side of freedom, because *both* are the sides of freedom for somebody, just in different ways. The real question is *which*, of the potential freedoms at risk, the different and competing *types* of freedom, are of the highest priority to society.

There's no simple method to answer questions like this. It's not something you could solve *a priori* from a laboratory. It took centuries of trial and error to arrive at the balance of things we know today. It's the product of historical experience---generations of debate, negotiation, experimentation, and compromise. The resulting consensus is what we call liberty, which is a great accomplishment---perhaps *the* accomplishment---of Western culture, and the main way to distinguish between a good society and a bad one.

The most telling demonstration of morality is how one treats the people who are at one's mercy. Imagine you're wanted by the law, or a soldier at war---if you can't escape, do you consider surrendering? If it's the good guys you're fighting against, the answer may be yes, because you can trust you'll be treated fairly in our system. But if we're the bad guys, you should fear being tortured, abused, extorted, left to starve, or executed. This sort of distinction is clear in our history (Allies vs. Axis Powers, or the First World vs. the USSR), and in present-day political differences (US and Europe vs. China, Russia, North Korea, Iran), and reflected storytelling real and fiction (*Lord of the Rings*, *Game of Thrones*, *Star Trek*, *Star Wars*). The good guys treat their prisoners humanely. The evil empire doesn't. That's in large part why we consider it the evil empire. And that's why we in the West react negatively and are always vigilant to prevent the trampling of rights in such ways.

This different attitude toward individual rights is the main reason I'd never seriously consider or feel comfortable living in some corrupt second-world country no matter how wealthy or innovative a few of their cities appear in travel brochures. Far more important than any material wealth is the trust I place in their institutions. In which place would you rather be under police investigation, or be made to appear in court, or be made to serve prison time? In which place would you feel more comfortable criticizing or speaking out against those in power? These are the questions that speak to the virtue of society, in a way that factors like economic output or even crime rates fundamentally cannot.

A belief in the importance of individual liberty is today captured by the term **liberalism**. This became the predominant view in Europe after **the Enlightenment**, and it has since become foundational to Western political culture. The related concepts began forming under monarchist regimes, where rulers were 'absolutist' in rhetoric but not in fact (i.e. their *de jure* power was absolute at times, but of course their *de facto* power could never be so). When a country felt their monarch had overstepped his or her boundaries, there would be conflict, and as a result the monarch would end up having to sign away some of their power by recognizing the rights of other people in society, and delegating power and responsibilities to increasingly democratic institutions existing in parallel with the Crown. In this way liberalism and democracy were not things that came about suddenly, but things we grew into over centuries.

A change to institutions can appear sudden when the underlying beliefs and attitudes took a century to change, but only a year for somebody to finally acknowledge that reality and update their laws or procedure, which can appear even more sudden when quickly glossed over as part of historical analysis of many centuries. The most significant turning points we look back on today were generally the result of material, technological changes that put pressure on parts of society that would have changed otherwise eventually, and which in some cases may have undergone *better* change had they more time to adapt.

In the early modern period there was an agricultural revolution in the 17th century and then in the late 18th century came the industrial revolution, beginning in Britain and then spreading elsewhere, completely disrupting the economic norms and labour relations our society had been used to for centuries prior. The demand for agricultural labour collapsed, the population that had been spread throughout the country were upended from their homes and funnelled into cities, where the industrialists, businessmen, and financiers of this new economy were able to demand anything they wanted of of, for the balance of power in labour relations, that had been negotiated over many generations, was effectively wiped away. Productivity soared, our life became increasingly defined by the circulation of commodities, and all the profit accrued back to the owners of capital, and our society entered into an era where the wealthiest men were not the ones who controlled the most land and palaces, but the ones who controlled the most money, giving form to the *bourgeoisie* (originally, 'people of the boroughs'). The power of the landed aristocracy meanwhile waned, and general social unrest in this period contributed to the instability of monarchist governments, which were increasingly criticized by advocates of democracy and of increasing trade.

Among the later were English rationalists following the influence of **Adam Smith** (1723--1790), remembered most of all for his *Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations* (1776), his *magnum opus* for which he became known as the father of economics and the father of capitalism. There was little work in political economy as a field of thought before Smith, and real-world economic policy was largely dominated by what is now called mercantilism, in which monarchs operated economies for the express purpose of maximizing national resources in competition with other states, and high tariffs were the norm because to import resources from another country was seen as a loss. The reality of the efficiency of international trade was catching up to them, to the great advantage of all countries but to the detriment to the relative power of the monarch within each country.

### Distinguishing concepts

Sometimes people say 'individual liberty' or 'personal liberty'---this is redundant (often for emphasis); the concepts are personal or individual in nature. If so put, it's only for rhetorical purposes. In colloquial speech, many people also mix up liberty and freedom as concepts---and perhaps their *rights*, as well. These terms do have some conceptual overlap, so it's understandable, but we should define them and distinguish between them. This helps ensure we navigate the topic more clearly.

* **Freedom** is the most abstract, undefined idea: the state of being free, i.e. able to take an action without restraint (being free to do such and such), or to avoid having something done to you (being free *from* such and such).
* **Liberty** then refers to a more specific idea: the set of freedoms that we've decided are especially socially important---not just *some* freedoms, but *these* freedoms, the ones that we traditionally value. Liberty may then be understood as our *traditional freedoms*.
* A **right**, meanwhile, is any legal entitlement. Some of your rights are to things we consider part of liberty, but some are not. As a concept, a right is just anything you're legally entitled to.

Freedom and liberty may come into conflict, because one person's demand for freedom may conflict with the essential freedoms of others and therefore be destructive to liberty. After all, for my freedom to be absolute and maximal would be for your freedom to be destroyed. I would effectively be your dictator: my freedom to steal, to kill, and do as I please would override your freedom *from* any of my actions. Our *liberty*, on the other hand, may coëxist in harmony, because there is a balance that has been created by both of us having the right to *some* freedoms, but not others. So it's really liberty, not *freedom*, that is the key to our social flourishing.

### Positive and negative rights

In modern political theory, many people distinguish between positive and negative rights---typically people who want to stress the relative importance of the latter. The nature of this difference is that to oblige a positive right (say to water) demands action (providing them water), while to oblige a negative right (such as to free speech) demands inaction or restraint (not doing anything to censor them), which could be achieved simply by our absence. Conversely then, to deprive somebody of a positive right means to no longer do that action (stop providing the water), while to deprive somebody of a negative right means to take action against them (in this case, censor them).

A different angle of explanation is to say *negative rights* are to things you would have 'by default' if you were alone in the wilderness, with no other people around, while *positive rights* are to things that require the labour of others to provide. It wouldn't make sense to speak of a right to legal counsel if you were stranded on an island by yourself with nobody else around, would it? Nor would I say anybody is 'denying you your rights' in such a case. For you to be being denied your rights would require there being people around who *could* have provided you those things, but chose not to.

The distinction makes sense in theory, that is to say, in our imagination. The problem is *in isolation*---if there were no society---none of these things would really be *rights* at all, just as in the absence of society none of your actions would be legal or illegal. We don't in any real sense have a right without a society to recognize and affirm that to be the case. Such things are only interpretable in a social context. It's the relations between people that gives rise to concepts like these.

In any real society, meanwhile, this distinction between positive and negative blurs. Freedom only seems like the default in isolation because there are no other people around to infringe upon you; but the natural state of humanity isn't isolation, it's community. From the smallest tribe or village to a grand city, until some means of common defense is organized, your freedom is insecure because anybody with the means to do so could take it away from you. They could overpower you, they could outnumber you. *That* is the default state of man. It's only after we come together, to make systems of force, that we get law and order---and from that, we get safety, liberty, and peace.

*Negative rights* are only 'negative' in theory. In practice, all rights are de facto 'positive' rights, in the sense they all must be 'provided' by the labour of some other person in your society---whether police, courts, military, civil services, or something else. You aren't a one-man army, and your rights don't enforce theirselves. This raises the question of just how useful this distinction even is, if our goal is to understand actual existing societies rather than men alone on deserted islands. After addressing the problems with it, the positive--negative distinction is something I almost never find worth even mentioning. It's simply not that useful or interesting an idea.

The necessity of systems of force in order to have any rights at all, positive or negative, was understood very early in the development of political philosophy. In his 1651 book Leviathan, the grand old philosopher **Thomas Hobbes** (1588--1679) describes how the 'natural condition of mankind' is only the 'laws of nature'---which leads to 'a war of every man against every man' in which people are free to do anything, including assault others, and nobody is secure. Such a world would have no industry, no culture, no buildings, no agriculture, no recorded knowledge---only fear and darkness and a likely violent death. And it's only the creation of the state, and our submission to that state, that allows humanity to ascend beyond this.

That is the great insight which eludes too many: liberty does not exist by default. It's something humanity must work to create, and work to preserve---and the mechanism we use to achieve this is, in all places, the organization of violence. And for this, we must pay significant cost, both in the form of our obligations to the system, and our accepting restraints put on us by that system.

^Notes:

^1. In LEVIATHAN, Hobbes describes this 'war' in chapter 13 ('Of The Naturall Condition Of Mankind, As Concerning Their Felicity, And Misery'). He describes common submission to the state in chapter 18 ('Of The Causes, Generation, And Definition Of A Common-wealth').
2. Modern sources often use the term 'war of all against all'. Hobbes does not use this exact phrase (he said 'warre of every man against every man'); it's an alternate, more direct translation from the Latin phrase 'bellum omnium contra omnes', which Hobbes does use in his other works.
3. Hobbes is sometimes misinterpreted as believing the ORIGIN of the state was the covenant (later, 'social contract') described in that chapter; but this was only a metaphor for what function the state comes to take on after some development (it is 'as though' such and such---that is not what literally occurs).
4. Hobbes was brilliant for his time and helped push forward the development of political philosophy, but also believed some things that are ludicrous by today's standards. He should be considered a PRECURSOR to our thought, and nothing more.

### Rights realism

The American and French revolutions both had lasting effects on our political language, due in large part to the rhetoric employed by revolutionaries---from their speeches, journals, and pamphlets, to the language written into official documents. They inherited from **the Enlightenment**---a period of intellectual change throughout the 17th and 18th Centuries, led by writers such as Rousseau, Descartes, Kant, Voltaire, Locke, and Hume. Its major themes included a rejection of the *divine right of kings*, a belief in the separation of church and state, and advocacy for religious freedom and tolerance.

Not without great cost, the Enlightenment helped usher in a new age of prosperity and reform across Europe. The lingering downside has been that, for all the good it brought, Enlightenment philosophy wasn't *perfect*, and the success of these revolutions meant any mistakes or shortcomings of the time were crystallized in various documents---to be studied, revered, and celebrated as national artefacts that continue to influence people to this day. Those mistakes and shortcomings are therefore particularly tenacious.

Though both revolutions featured significant anti-religious sentiment (especially anti-*Catholic* in the French case, leading to the violent persecution of many innocent priests and nuns), they naturally couldn't help but appeal to ideas religious in origin---just as even an atheist today casually says 'my god' as an expression. Especially troublesome was the notion that our political rights are not created socially, but exist independently, as though some objective feature of the world. Today this view lacks a good conventional name. If nothing else, it should be called *rights realism*.

Look to the American revolutionaries, for example, who opposed the formation of a state church, ensured their people's religious freedom, and at least didn't mention any *specific* religion in either their *Declaration of Independence* nor their new constitution---but still burned these words into our history:

||indent
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
--- United States Declaration of Independence (1776)

The French Revolution, meanwhile, gave us *Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité*---a motto popularized by Robespierre himself, and so memorable it would later become France's official national motto---yet discourse about *Liberty* was celebrated in the abstract, not as a feature of society but as an axiom of the mind, detached from any allegiance, duty, or responsibility.

So too was this the case in the *Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen*---that great human rights document published by the French National Constituent Assembly, and later incorporated as part of the French constitution. Here they call the rights they favour 'natural and imprescriptible', though at least without *explicitly* mentioning a 'Creator' as their origin.

||indent
"Article II -- The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression. …"
--- Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789)

The purpose of this rhetoric at the time was to arm the revolution with feelings of clarity, certainty, and confidence---and to that end it was successful. But if taken as a real belief, as more than only political rhetoric, a modicum of scrutiny reveals it to be vacuous nonsense. How do I know if a creator has 'endowed' me with something, whatever that even means? Who decides which rights are the 'natural' ones? And am I seriously meant to think everybody, even slaves in ancient history, all had these unspoken *rights* to their freedom, but that nobody, not even they, were aware of? How can such rights be said to 'exist'? What does it even mean at that point? These questions have answers---but not good answers. At the end of the day, it's about as absurd as suggesting the English language 'existed' a million years ago, just nobody had figured out the words and grammar yet.

The best explanation for rights realism is that it's a repurposing of the logic behind the divine right of kings---a reversal of it, as though somebody heard their king say "It's my right to do such and such, because god said so" and thought to theirselves, "Well, if the King may use that logic, then so shall we! What prevents us?", and got to work. This is why I say even if people remove all explicit references to god, rights realism is still an idea that born of religious thinking (even if it has been *superficially* 'secularized'). In both the French and American usages, all such talk really communicates is the opinion of those authors that these rights are especially important, and ergo all people should be granted them. If so expressed, that would be an entirely fair position, albeit mundane. The waters are only muddied because this language ('unalienable', 'imprescriptible', 'natural', etc.) implies something else---something more. And there is nothing more.

Nor is there with 'human rights', a term I gladly use. It means those rights we consider basic and fundamental, the ones that we should afford all people by default, no matter who they are. But admitting this to be merely your *opinion*, an expression of your values rather than an observation of some material fact of the universe, doesn't sound as *grand* as pretending that a *god* agrees with you, does it?

A lack of appreciation for the social nature of rights and liberty leads to various ideological mishap, not only in idealistic liberals but in more serious condemnations of institutional power, such as by (left-wing) European anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. Bakunin, Goldman) and (right-wing) libertarians in the United States in the 20th century (e.g. Rothbard, Tucker). Though with different ends in mind, they made what is fundamentally the same flawed claim: that the state is really the *enemy* of their liberty, and we should therefore seek to minimize and eventually abolish it (to be replaced with god knows what).

Their rationale was all too simple: government restricts our freedom (such as by making laws that forbid you rape or murder your neighbour)---ergo less government is more freedom, more government is less freedom, and maximal freedom would be achieved by no government at all. They were significantly inspired by the French and American revolutions, in some cases argue they were merely *taking those movements to their logical end*. (There is nothing that fascinates the minds of certain people more than the appearance of consistency.)

In the end their position ends up being akin to a person who's told their truck will move faster the less it weighs, and therefore proposes we remove its engine---because engines are heavy, so the truck will be lighter without it. That should help it run faster, no? There's a glimmer of logic there, but also a fundamental misunderstanding of things.

## Individualism

There are people---like the anarchists and libertarians mentioned earlier---who come to view nearly all political issues through a lens of **individualism versus collectivism**, which means the extent to which a group or institution makes demands of its individual members. They may tolerate some compromise to afford the bare necessities of civilization, but they want to keep the demands of *the collective* to a minimum. They may even decide their stance on specific political questions simply by applying this attitude, e.g. they could favour the legality of abortion because to prohibit abortion seems like the collective telling an individual what to do, as opposed to having that stance for any rationale specific to the morality of that issue.

There is clearly an enduring appeal to a life of independence, to withdrawing in some way or another from the structure and rules of civilization. It's a notion people romanticize, because it promises the potential to live as closely as possible to your natural impulses, to your unrestrained *ego*. That's the psychological draw of the Wild West, the drifter, the wanderer, but also of the homesteader, the small farmer living off the land, the recluse who lives alone in a cabin in the woods---undisturbed, maximal peace of mind.

The aesthetics of such a life are admired even by people who don't turn it into ideology. But it's more something to reminisce and fantasize about than really *live*---what you would have to give up simply isn't worth it, at least not for the vast majority of us. Even after making peace with obeying the law, there are just so many ways to 'purchase' the benefit of some system or another by either making a commitment to do something or accepting a restraint being imposed on you---in both cases, agreeing to what's necessary to *create* that very benefit.

There are many situations in life where 'for this to work, we need to all do it'---or at least, nearly all of us. And if we do, the benefit is well worth the cost. And yet paradoxically, if left to our own devices, we simply won't. This dilemma is called the **collective action problem**: the fact intelligent people, acting rationally, so often fail to work together for their mutual benefit. There are numerous reasons this occurs; the one most often discussed in political theory is the **free-rider problem**, which is about the overconsumption of public goods (leading to what's called a **tragedy of the commons**). All the choices that comprise a system happen at the individual level, so for a system to work it needs to make sense at the individual level for people to engage in. If a system is set up in such a way that demands people act in a way that makes no sense at the individual level, they won't, and the system will stop working.

### The free-rider problem

The name 'free-rider problem' originates from a specific hypothetical: suppose a city has a train system, and to fund it people are asked to pay a fee when they board. If there's no enforcement mechanism, people will neglect to pay (thus becoming 'free riders'), and the system will fail---even if all people could afford it, they all understand inadequate funding will cause a train shutdown, and none of them prefer that outcome. It doesn't matter. They still just won't pay. They will all choose to be free riders instead.

It seems stupid at a glance, but the reason this happens is their choice will never be the deciding factor, and they know it. That being so, they have nothing to gain by paying this fee. Examined as an individual choice, it's just throwing money away. Put differently, think of it like this: if everybody else pays the fee and I don't, that's fine; the train will have enough money to keep running; they don't need me. If *nobody* else pays the fee but I do, my payment alone won't be enough to keep the system afloat. The trains will either have enough funding or not, regardless of what I do. This is called a **diffusion of responsibility**---the realization that you're a drop in the bucket and can't change the big picture, so it's really just up to *everyone else* to do their part.

Many situations in life exemplify this dynamic. Why pay taxes, for instance? Taxation is a vital social function precisely because it allows a country to fund things people *want* to be funded, but *wouldn't* donate to individually because---if not so compelled---they would all just be free-riders of those things instead. We can understand criminal activity and the necessity of law enforcement through this lens as well. It benefits you to live in a place where nobody steals from one another, but it benefits you *even more* if *you* can steal from *others*, but *nobody else* steals from *you*. That's the most ideal position, really: to be the lone rulebreaker. But of course, if we all reason likewise, we all steal from one another, and the system is ruined.

#### What's the solution?

How do we make systems with individual costs but shared group benefits possible? There are numerous possible solutions, which may also be seen as different forms of the same general solution, as they all involve creating *individual* costs or benefits to reflect the corresponding *collective* costs and benefits that result from our choices. This bridges the gap between the personal and group interest, tips the scales of people's personal decision-making. In economic terms, our goal is to 'internalize the externalities'.

For a train company, the answer is simple: hire security guards to inspect tickets; issue fines for noncompliance. This forces people to either pay the fee or risk getting caught. That outweighs the benefit of small savings, and ergo changes people's behaviour. The trains could also just have been publicly funded, though this only changes the location of the enforcement mechanism, from buying the ticket to paying taxes. In both cases, the 'solution' is still making the funding mandatory, not leaving it to individual choice.

For other problems, we might create *benefits* for compliance, rather than costs for noncompliance. So long as it becomes comparatively more advantageous to comply, the number of people who choose to comply will increase; any approach that achieves this will do.

A great example of this is voting in public elections, by itself a completely irrational waste of time that will never change anything (voting *in aggregate* changes a lot, but *your vote* will never change the outcome)---and yet, we've created this environment where it's your civic duty to vote, an act of patriotism even. Make your voices heard! We pat you on the back, we give you buttons and stickers congratulating you, and then go home and shame anyone who *didn't* vote, and talk about who we voted for and ask others whom they voted for, as though it matters. This is all a ritual, essentially, whose main purpose is increasing the voting rate.

If that didn't work, we could also just fine people for not voting. Some countries do (Belgium, Australia, Ecuador, Luxembourg).

### Social duty

This is how you might also understand notions of social duty in general. The train-car that you're riding with the rest of us is your country. Just by being here, you're entitled to an array of services and protection. And what is asked of you in return? What is the fee to ride? That you pay taxes to a common fund, if you are so required. That you follow the law. In some time and place, you may be called for military service. That is all we forcibly require of you. But things work even better if you do more than this bare minimum, and we induce this not legally, but through social means, through pressure, expectation, and as an honour system. You're supposed to feel a sense of duty to serve the interests not only of your state, but of your family, your community, and your country in the broadest sense. And one of the most basic, fundamental ways you can do so is through the organization of the family, the cell of civil society.

The morality of other people in society affects your life not only directly by their attacking you, but by how it affects the systems in which you live. If the rate at which assault, muggings, or home break-ins are reported rises in a given area, the demand for police presence there increases. If shoplifting becomes more common, businesses may hire more security, put up cameras, lock items behind a cage you need a store clerk to open for you. The worse people behave, the more demanding and invasive our systems must be, the more present they will be in daily life, in order to better discipline the impulse of the people within. Conversely, the better we all behave, the more smoothly everything works, the more we're able to trust one another, the less we must rely on threat of force to get each other to play by the rules. In a good area, we solve disputes by honour and words, and crime is uncommon even absent police presence, because people have a conscience and choose to be good.

Where do people get their values? What is it that determines whether they're good people that add to social order or bad people who subtract from it? There are other factors, but none outweigh the manner in which we're raised, the character of the people who are most present in our lives from the beginning. This is what's meant when we say family is the cell of civil society. It all starts there. So if you have a realistic appreciation of your society, but your goal is to be as free and unburdened as possible while still living under the shade of its protection, then you should want to maintain as moral a population as possible, and contribute to that end yourself.

Noncompliance with rules tends to influence others because social norms are intuitively reciprocal by nature. If one student breaks a rule and gets away with it, other students see that and will decide they can get away with it too. If there's an implicit agreement between us, and you're not upholding your end of the arrangement, then I'm not going to feel as obliged to uphold mine. So, if other people are being polite, it makes us feel that we should be too. If nobody is littering, it makes us feel like we shouldn't be either. But if others aren't doing their part, it makes us feel less inclined to do ours. Bad behaviour begets bad behaviour. Why restrict your actions for the good of society, if others in society won't do the same for you? A virtuous person may do so anyway, of course, but the likelihood of people not following a norm increases the more other people don't follow it either.

### Religion

There is no god. I say this now to ensure there is no mistake about where I stand on that question. It's my hope our society someday comes to view Christianity in the same way as we already do Greek mythology: something that may be interesting to study for historical reasons, or to gain some insight into the psychology of the culture that produced it, but which obviously didn't actually happen, and which would be rather silly to take literally. For some conservatives, however, religion is the *centrepiece* of politics. It is their highest value, that which ultimately outweighs all else. Such people often share our political or social values, but mistakenly believe those values require a supernatural entity to be their origin, and mistakenly believe this origin to be their religion. They fear losing that origin will mean losing the values. In other words, they fear increasing godlessness will lead, or does lead, not only to a decline in church attendance, but ultimately to the loss of all morality and disintegration of our social order.

They have this fear despite the fact our actual beliefs and values clearly differ from those of their book. In the case of the West, with our history of Christianity, notice how the Bible doesn't even condemn rape or slavery, and its notion of morality has no connection at all with how your choices affect others---only whether or not you're acting in accordance with the ruler's will. Indeed, Christians are *required* to believe that when their god murders children---as he does numerous times in the Bible---it is necessarily moral of him to do so. And if god were to come down from heaven tomorrow and torture all of our children in front of us, that too would be moral of him. Find me a Christian who truly thinks like this. It's an act, a performance, something they *say* they believe only because they understand it's required of them. It's not truly what any of them have in their heart.

Perhaps thousands of years ago, at the dawn of Christianity, those early followers of Jesus had something novel to say about morality. To be charitable, to forgive one another---something contrary to the excesses of the society they knew. But modern people all have a sense of morality that is independent from their religion, not derived from it, and definitely at odds with it. They simply look away to avoid having to confront that reality and reconcile their statements. Indeed, most religious people work backwards, casting the moral compass in their head *onto* their religion, and then *telling theirselves* it was really this book that gave them their sense of right and wrong. It takes effort to maintain that deception.

Nor is there any evidence to suggest declining adherence to religion will cause a decline in morality or social standards. Some of the least religious countries are some of the most advanced, orderly, peaceful, and happy places on the planet. They didn't descend into misery and lawlessness as they came to regard these stories as myth instead of real history. Conversely, the most religious countries are some of the last places I should ever want to find myself.

That said, I do feel some interest in defending not the *content* of religious belief, but the *institution* of religion in the church. Churches are little community centres all throughout our society, whose members voluntarily provide a social function that nothing else seems quite able to replicate. The appearance of being a religious organization may provide cover to be abusive or hateful in a way that won't be criticized as much as if one acted in this way in a different context. However, the vast majority of churches are assets to their surrounding populations. I have attended several, in every town or city I've lived in. The typical experience is a selfless, kindhearted man doing his best to uplift you and everybody else there, strangers though you are to him. These days, sometimes it's a woman.

They don't just droningly read the Bible at you from cover to cover; they choose specific stories of interest, and relate it to issues we may be facing in our lives. They encourage us to be kind to one another and our families, to forgive people who have wronged us. They may speak about international affairs, sharing news of the conditions of people in faraway places, people who are suffering war and poverty that we don't know in the West. They invite us to pray for them, and to be thankful for what we have. They tell us about some charity the church itself is organizing on Thursday, if you're interested in coming by and helping out. It would be an extraordinary loss for our society if churches disappeared.

Churches have historically been involved in organizing hospitals, founding schools, universities. They supported artists, musicians, writers. Monastic communities maintained libraries, translated and copied texts, not only religious but scientific and philosophical works. The Catholic Church in particular is usually credited for its role in preserving knowledge across Europe after the fall of Rome. Church figures were always involved in politics and diplomacy, always advocates for peace and justice. The misdeeds of some priest or another today could never compare with the incredible amount of good these organizations have done for the world over the years.

Could we separate social function from believing? Would anybody join an 'atheist church', that lacks a belief in the divine, but otherwise does all the things churches do? Perhaps not. I know some people will argue faith is what makes the church sustainable, and the great longevity of our current churches demonstrates this. I'm not certain, but I will tentatively argue otherwise. I doubt that most normal people, even ones who attend church regularly, truly believe Biblical events happened in the same way they believe, say, the Napoleonic Wars happened. This may have not been the case long ago, back when the typical person was far more ignorant of the world and of what was even possible, and I don't know when the changeover would've happened, but it wouldn't have been obvious from one day to the next. Ordinary people just go along with the claims of their religion, without ever really stopping to think and focus on the absurdities the church has asked them to accept. They attend because it feels normal. They don't think about it critically because they have no real reason to. There could be great masses of people who lack a sincere religious conviction, but who nonetheless carry on going through the motions as *though* they do, and how could you tell the difference?

And if I'm right about that, consider the consequences of the fact our churches are still up and running. What would happen if, at church service, we all paused, looked around, and we all admitted to ourselves that none of us believe things in the Bible *really happened*? Would that really ruin the experience? Couldn't we acknowledge that, and then just go back to what we were doing? The more I've thought about it, the less absurd it seems.

There is a third component. There is the *content* of religion (the cultural storytelling that you should not take literally), there is religion *as an institution* (which has largely been a positive force), but finally there is *religious thinking*, which is very likely to *infect* (and *degrade*) people's *political* thinking. This is the context in which I've been most hostile to religion throughout my time discussing it. The notion there *is* (and *must* be) a god, and that this god has somehow commanded us to believe a certain thing, or to avoid doing something or other, drives people to be impossibly stubborn in defense of stupid ideas. They are cursed to feel confidently in beliefs or values they cannot properly ground or justify, because in place of an argument they have the *feeling* that some all-powerful entity is in agreement with them (what more validation do they need?); and they are far less capable of seeing things from other perspectives, because they think anybody who disagrees with the objective truth their god has revealed to them is *simply wrong*---but again, for reasons that cannot properly be *explained*, only asserted with conviction. Their politics is ultimately just an extension of their faith, and their faith is immune to reason, ergo their politics is immune to reason. I despise conversation with such people.

The way religion operates---the way it gets people to go along with it---is by asking us to make an exception to our otherwise rational thinking. We all have some grasp on reality, a sense of what is obviously real and what is obviously fiction. This is how, if you'd never heard of the *Chronicles of Narnia* and I gave you a copy of it to read, you wouldn't need to ask me whether it's a true story or not---you could *tell* it isn't. When you go to Church and hear a story from the Bible, you're asked to set that grasp on reality aside, to treat this collection of stories differently from everything else in your life.

Imagine claims identical in nature to those of the Bible, but set elsewhere. Say a series of journals is unearthed in China tomorrow, in which a group of people all claim to have seen something fantastic, which we know is impossible. They all claim a traveller came to their town, pulled the moon out of the sky and put it in his pocket, then cut himself in half with a sword, but then put himself back together, and flew off over the horizon just by flapping his arms. Would anybody entertain that this story may have really happened? Not for a moment. And that's how Christians today would view their own religion, if they could read the Bible today for the first time without the bias of all its surrounding context.

Not only would the Bible be considered fiction, but it would be derided as a particularly *bad* work of fiction, one whose central narrative makes no sense at all and whose minor stories have no real morals aside from telling you, by the authority of god's might, what to believe. This is why they get and get you young, threaten you with fear of punishment, and peer-pressure you into participating before you fully understand what you're getting into. They need you to accept it irrationally, because there's no chance you would accept it rationally.

Most people are religious, but not many people are *very* religious. It's the very religious ones you want to keep away from the levers of power, as they can never *really* be trusted. Their true loyalty, before all else, will always be to the voice in their head, to their personal interpretation of whatever they *think* some divine entity wants of them, those *true believers*. Many of them are even aware of how off-putting this is to normal people and so they will, under normal circumstances, play their cards very close to their chest---but when they occasionally slip up and tell or show you who they really are, you should believe them.

This is why the separation of church and state has become such an important tradition for the Western world, and why *theocracy* implies tyranny. Throughout European history, the Church and Crown were always *related* entities in that the Crown sought approval from the Church, but the Church was not given to directly govern, and periodically what political influence the Church had attained then had to be wrestled away from it. In this respect, I've always considered the English Reformation---when our King Henry VIII finally stood up to the authority of the Pope and assumed control of the Church of England---to be a very proud moment in our history (albeit this created other, different problems that we had to address later).

## Democracy

For some time, democracy was a thing whose praises we all sang together. The great powers all went through revolutions to become more democratic; then in World War II, and again in the Cold War, democratic countries were pitted against undemocratic ones---and twice democracy emerged victorious. Voting and criticizing our leaders became part of our civic identity; a broad democratic attitude became part of who we are. But just as democracy took work to establish, it takes work to maintain. It must be actively defended, not taken for granted---otherwise people may gradually lose faith in it, tempted by the superficial allure of some other, inferior system (often with a fiery demagogue its advocate).

I periodically come across arguments in defense of monarchy, for instance. They identify the advantages of ending up with a good ruler whose position is stable and long-lasting. And of course, if you take an ideal, moral king who is deeply invested in the health of the nation, and compare him with an unscrupulous elected politician who has no regard for what happens to us after his four-year term, the king is appealing. But what if that's not how things are bundled together? What of the cruel, stupid king versus the kind, competent governor whom the people have supported instead? If you get to craft every aspect of the comparison, you can paint any picture you like. In making these comparisons, they ask we disregard all the great elected leaders we've had, and all the monarchs throughout history who've ruined their own countries by mismanagement and brutality *despite* the guaranteed longevity of their inherited seats.

In a sense, monarchy is the most natural form of government. It appears all over the world and all throughout history, in societies that are otherwise as different as could be. It's simply the reality that one person must be above all others, mixed with a society that allows this apex position to be inherited per the will of its previous occupant. The moment some powerful man leaves his position to his son, it begins. There is something simple and intuitive about that, because we all understand family, inheritance, and the desire to pass things down to your children. The public, who have accepted and grown fond of and loyal to their leader, have an easier time transferring that loyalty to the leader's children than to some other person. And they consider allowing that child to inherit, and following the wishes of their leader, the right thing to do.

As for the king's perspective, there are few people he will trust more to replace him someday than his own child whom he's raised with that eventuality in mind. There also used to be a problem when it came to finding people who were *qualified* to be in positions of leadership in the first place. The pool of options would always be slim: the vast majority of people in society weren't even literate; they knew nothing of government, diplomacy, finance, military, administration. A prince born into the world of power was likely to have few competitors for most qualified candidate. Today most of these advantages have faded away, due to widespread education and technology, and for the fact we've developed our national identity in such a way that people are loyal to ideas, institutions, and procedures, instead of to a specific person or their family. The latter harks back to a clan culture, before the formations of cities and empires, when power was held by the tribal chiefs and elders known by all people personally. Though people like me find value in it still, the reality is the percentage of the public who care about their country's monarch has been slowly decreasing.

The progression from monarchy to democracy should probably be viewed as a natural part of a civilization maturing and the state itself transitioning from being a more private thing to a more public one. In the beginning it is essentially the arm of a powerful family of aristocrats (the hereditary warrior class), but gradually the residents of their territory develop into a community, a nation---an identity emerges, and with it a relationship between ruler and ruled, causing people to feel as *members* of that institution. The seat of power naturally becomes about far more than only the whims of the man it seats; the position becomes less 'the king *of this territory*' and more 'the king *of this people*'. (The French explicitly made this change, calling their leader 'King of the French' instead of 'King of France' for a time---but this transition of understanding and attitude also happened in countries that didn't formalize it.)

I'd like to clarify that monarchy isn't an *immoral* form of governance. If there were some country that had a reasonable monarch and things were generally working out for them, I wouldn't demand they abolish it and install democracy, as we may do if they were practicing slavery or slaughtering one another, or some other terrible action like that. The people of that country may someday come to oppose their monarch and pursue democratic reforms, but it's on them to do so at their own pace, and if things are working out fine for them now, there's no rush. I also value the existence of monarchies in countries like Britain even as powerless relics of the nation. Their existence is a social good, a connection to our history and identity. They're like living monuments.

### The spirit of democracy

There is more to democracy than voting. There is a broader democratic ethos, or spirit---the *idea* that the government *should* be a reflection of the values and priorities of its populace. The primary mechanism for expressing a preference *to* the system is voting---but for this to be politically meaningful requires also that people are able to criticize their current leaders, to organize an opposition, and to advocate for that opposition to gain power in society to replace the current leadership. In this way, a democratic system requires not just voting, but a degree of freedom of speech, of the press, the freedom to run for office, the right to vote without intimidation or interference, and perhaps other things. It's the coming together of these elements that creates a democratic environment, one in which the public is able to oppose its leaders and appoint new ones if that is required.

But why *should* this be the case? The most obvious answer is we think it important for government to be a reflection of the values and priorities of its populace to help reduce conflict or tension between the two. If an undemocratic government were to do whatever it likes and in so doing harmed its own population, and this carried on for some time, it's going to lead to problems, possibly violence and revolt. But there's no objective answer to how this abstract notion---'the government should be a reflection of popular values or priorities'---ought to be implemented, or translated into policy or procedure. **There are going to be some things that can be solved through voting, and some things that probably shouldn't be.** And *within* a democratic system, things that aren't done through voting are often called 'anti-democratic', as in an 'anti-democratic check' (on democracy itself), but this doesn't mean their existence contradicts a belief in democracy generally, because these things can in their own right be democratically confirmed. That is, most people in a society can support the idea of delegating a certain decision to something other than their own vote.

An uncontroversial example is a regulatory body. In every country, there is some kind of government agency whose role is to inspect pharmaceuticals and enforce relevant safety regulations. How does Canada determine whether a certain pill is safe for market? Do we ask Health Canada (the department of the federal government whose employees are designated to make such decisions); or do we hold a national referendum, where we ask everybody in the country whether *they* think the pill is safe? In a sense, having Health Canada make this decision for us is an 'anti-democratic' method of solving this problem, but it's also one that we're all fine with.

When it comes to making legislation, this is also what's done. We have a *representative democracy* because the average person has no idea how to translate their abstract desires (e.g. "public transit in the city isn't as good as I want it to be") into actionable policy---at least, for most things. We don't know how to appropriate funding to what departments, what aspects of everything are important, what the consequences will be of the way each line is written. It's a whole profession for a reason. There are some issues not like this, however, where instead the central question is entirely one of *sentiment*, and this is where holding a public referendum can be perfectly appropriate. A fine example of this is to answer whether a state should issue marriage licenses to same-gender couples, or any other 'cultural' issue in politics that actually demands policy decisions (most don't).

We have many rules that augment democratic expression, so things are not 'direct' but instead begin with the people and then are filtered through various systems. A simple example is an agreement made by elected representatives to only pass a piece of legislation that's supported by something more than 50 percent of them, which effectively means there will be times that a majority want a certain bill passed, but the minority 'wins' in that they succeed at blocking it---but this is something we agree to ahead of time, by saying that we should change course from our current laws by a threshold greater than a slim majority. Again, it's an 'anti-democratic' measure that is supported democratically.

### Tyranny of the majority

Every so often, there is a disagreement about some policy, and the option that is popular with voters is considered, by its opponents, to be unfair. "This is tyranny of the majority", they say. The concept, under some name or another, has been present in political thought so long as there has *been* political thought. When people act in groups, the cost or blame of their action is split among the crowd, and people may choose things they would not if they were acting alone, with all cost and benefit placed only on theirselves. Each person also feels some level of pressure to *go with the flow*, to participate in what others in the crowd are already doing. We influence one another. So what if the result is that it's popular to commit injustice? What if everybody in a society votes to murder somebody? Moreover, if we allow decisions to be made by an angry mob, will things be more likely to end with injustice than if they were made by any single person? Such fears, where they are valid and where they are not, is the reason we have these anti-democratic checks baked into the design of our systems to begin with. Our governments were forged by people who had these same thoughts long ago.

We might also take a step back and ask what it means for something to be an injustice in the first place, because it does sound odd that everybody in society would agree to do something unjust. People tend to prefer justice. But the content of justice is subjective---if everybody in the world but me said an action is just, and I disagreed, what could I do to prove that I'm right and the rest of humanity is wrong? Perhaps I could try to establish common ground and persuade people to recognize they're being inconsistent, if they are, but otherwise you can't simply prove or disprove things like this---and even that approach depends on being able to find common ground, or areas where our intuition is alike, so in trying to determine what's just and what's unjust, there has to be some level of deference to what real people think.

This leads me to two likely options:

1. This person, who disagrees with some popular idea, has a sense of justice that is different from that of most people. For them, who knows how many normal things that you or I support could be, in their view, tyrannical.
I've spoken with many people who have unusual political views and who might consider, for example, having to pay taxes a form of tyranny being imposed onto them unjustly.
2. The crowd itself is doing something that its members will consider unjust, even by their own standards, after the fact. Perhaps people are being hasty, impassioned, not thinking clearly---they will regret their actions tomorrow. They need to sleep on it, reconsider, think things over, taking a breath before they proceed.
We have procedure for this very reason. When there's a decision to be made and it's about something controversial, we delay. There are motions we need to go through. It's not like thousands of years ago, where an actual angry mob pulls somebody into the streets and kills them. We have courts. This is less an argument against democracy, and more an argument against vigilante action and in favour of institutional action.

The first case is probably more interesting. **Do you have any opinions that more than 50 percent of your society disagrees with?** I expect you do. I hope you do. I hope everyone does. It would be very strange if you didn't. But for most things, if you disagree with me about some policy, I probably wouldn't describe your position as "tyrannical". Though containing some ambiguity, language like "tyranny", "oppression", or "evil" is usually reserved for something of more grave importance, that touches on something fundamental, that goes against our morals or principles. It's not just a name for anything I disagree with. So let's rephrase my question: is there anything that more than 50 percent of my society agrees with, that I consider tyranny? I gave this a few minutes' thought. I don't think there is. I live in a very good country.

But there are some places in the world where a majority of people would support things I consider oppressive---not just bad policy, but immoral policy. In countries like Iran or Zimbabwe, women and homosexuals are treated terribly, and in a way that most people there support. There are other countries where religious minorities are mistreated, or people of different ethnic groups are mistreated, or people of a low caste. In situations like these, what can I do? If everybody in those places believes their treatment of those people is just, and it's even validated by their procedure and institutions, then generally the most we can do is try and change what they think on the issue over time, and the situation may someday improve. This is where some people step in and pose a criticism of democracy. In these countries, after all, it's the majority who are supporting what I consider oppression. What if, instead, there was an undemocratic government that passed laws granting legal rights to the groups in question, against the will of the majority? This is an interesting question because it only works with us being outside observers, and it essentially is asking what we value more, between the specific laws or policies by which people live, or the meta-level procedural question of how a society should determine its laws or policies. If we believe that democracy is better than dictatorship, how do we interpret a situation where a dictator passes laws we favour, and democracy would've produced laws we don't favour? This could've been phrased the other way around: would you support your own country falling into dictatorship, if the dictator's views or policy agenda were to align with yours perfectly?

I would not like that. I wouldn't prefer it. I would help dismantle it. And most sensible people would join me. I could say it's because we have a principled belief in democracy---but the question is *why* we have a principled belief in democracy, or why that principle is more important than the prospect of getting all the policy we want. The answer is it sets a bad precedent: that dictatorship is a good method of getting the policy you desire. It also wouldn't last. Ultimately, going into the future, what do I believe leads to better outcomes a greater portion of the time, democracy or dictatorship? The answer is democracy. It's the better method, the better approach, the better way of doing things. So would I throw away democracy just because the dictator is going to get everything right this time? What happens if they change their tune tomorrow? We've surrendered our ability to do anything about it. We couldn't get rid of them, not without taking them to war. This represents an enormous risk. Only a fool wouldn't realize as much. And then even if you had a dictatorship of exceptional judgment and temperament, what about the next dictator? And the next?

Now take a step back. **Is this even a realistic dilemma?** How often is it that between the will of the majority and that of an undemocratic ruling class, the latter is the side of *less* oppression? It may happen sometimes. There's a concept that some people reference, of the ['enlightened despot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_absolutism), where certain European monarchs were influenced by Enlightenment thinking and led reforms in their respective countries without anybody needing to vote for it. Moreover, nobody would dispute that progress and positive reform under pre-democratic governments is possible. But that was *before* these countries became the democracies we know today. **How often do we think a country that has achieved democracy becomes less democratic, and this coincides with its people becoming freer?** Only cases of the exact opposite come to mind. There have been many countries to abandon democracy, or significantly damage their democracy, and in the process lose a significant portion of their freedom. That is the norm---not having to choose between them. It's generally freedom *and* democracy, not *or*.

A person might argue there are cases of 'enlightened despots' still in the undemocratic parts of the world today, such as in Saudi Arabia, where the government has in recent years allowed for various liberal reforms (e.g. less censorship of foreign media, increasing civil rights for women) and it seems the decisions are coming down from the top. But how do we verify this narrative, if a country isn't democratic? We don't know what people in the country think of all their current laws, because it's not up for debate. We don't know how different things could look there if they had democratic norms instead. We don't know how people would've voted, or what their elected politicians would've done (if they *had* elected politicians). There's indication that the people of Iran, for example, broadly *don't* support the current regime, which has ruled the country since 1989, and that country had more social freedom before then. However, even making the most charitable assumptions, what we end up with is far from an argument in favour of dismantling existing democracies. The critical question would be **how we imagine any society should be improved if we made it more difficult for people to remove their leaders in the event something goes wrong**. Framed this way, the absurdity of  more authoritarian thought becomes clear.

## Policy questions

For further clarity about my application of these ideas, I'll go over some popular issues, in no particular order. These aren't going to be comprehensive dives into any given topic, but skimming the surface of each to convey my feeling or approach about them.

### Abortion

In Canada, women can get abortions. How far into pregnancy, you ask? I don't know. I'd have to go search online for the answer, because it's not an issue anybody here often talks about. From what I recall, it wasn't a topic that came up at all during the last leaders' debate (a debate between party leaders, the people who would become Prime Minister if their party wins the most seats in Parliament). It must be allowed late enough into pregnancy that it's reasonable enough that people don't find it worth complaining about, so basically it's legal.

Every so often, if you're in a busy part of one of our cities, I'd see a handful of people who'd come to stand around on the street corner holding signs with pictures of fetuses on them, yelling for people's attention, trying to get us to think abortion is a terrible thing that we should all be against. I never got the impression anybody took those people seriously. They're mixed in with other street preachers and such, most of them at least somewhat crazy.

A typical pregnancy is 40 weeks. If you ban abortion after 6 weeks, you've effectively outlawed it, because women don't realize they're pregnant before then. If abortion is allowed until 20 weeks, then it's nearly wholly legal, because [something like 99 percent of abortions occur before then,](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states) and a majority occur before 12 weeks. So realistically, that's often where the debate ends up happening: do we forbid abortions in the 6--20 week range, or no? If we do, then we say abortion is effectively illegal, and if not then abortion is effectively legal (even if there are restrictions after that period). [Canada doesn't have any restrictions like this](https://www.arcc-cdac.ca/media/2020/07/statistics-abortion-in-canada.pdf) and hasn't for a long time, and that's fine with me. I feel no motivation to push for change.

### Climate change

In a sense, the environment is the most important issue of all, or at least it has the potential to be. The problem is how policies meant to address it are only shooting ourselves in the foot, unless it's in the form of an international agreement that other major powers are also following. There is likely no significant gain in going above and beyond, as the impact Canada makes in a global context is rather small. The potential cost of contributing to solving it, meanwhile, is unfortunately high for normal people in the country, at least by the methods we've attempted so far.

It occurs to me that in the grand scheme of things, humanity has likely many changes we'll need to make in the coming decades, unless some miracle cures are invented soon. It won't be taken well, because nobody wants to be told they'll have to settle for less. Less convenience, less waste, less excess, less consumption, and you'll have to pay more for things. Tell that to a crowd and see who elects you. But the way most of us live today isn't sustainable, especially as the undeveloped world is developing. We need to actually invest in building better systems, and probably take advantage of the 'good years' when the economy is strong and unemployment is low. The people won't be pleased with headlines about increasing carbon taxes when the economy is already struggling.

In theory, conservatism should be very much aligned with conserving the environment. The environment is a highly valuable thing that we must preserve for generations to come, and it's a complex thing, meaning we have reason to treat it with some caution because the impact we have on it can be difficult to predict. And if we err and do great damage to the environment, it may be difficult to reverse.

### Gay marriage

I argued in favour of marital equality back when the topic was more commonly the focus of discussion. The problem with the way that some people argued for this position is they would act as though marital equality were the default position and that somebody must justify *not* having marital equality. That is, they would say marital equality is justified without really thinking much about the arguments against or in favour of it, just because, well, why not?

The argument is that if marriage is a good thing for the straight population---which seems to be agreed upon by all---then it would also be good for the gay population. They would benefit from it in the same way. In fact, it should help address some of the main areas of behaviour for which the gay community is sometimes criticized, like their being too short-term oriented and not settling down into long-term relationships.

The arguments against marriage equality were numerous concerns about downstream or indirect social consequences that, after giving fair consideration, I didn't feel were of significant merit. Some of these concerns relied upon treating homosexual affection as though something more frivolous or voluntary than it's believed to be today. There were people who didn't want to 'validate' a gay relationship, because they thought doing so would lead to more gay people in society, or other concerns like this. It was also often an unspoken assumption that gay people, if they were not allowed to be gay, would simply choose to be straight instead. We know now this is not the case, and that gay people are going to exist in every society, in every generation of every society, whether we accept them or abuse and mistreat them.

I also note the movement for social acceptance of gay rights didn't happen instantly. It took us decades, and there was significant caution and public discourse about every step of the way, meaning this wasn't quick or imprudent change. There was due friction. As such, there is nothing about the nature of this change that contradicts conservative ideals about how social change ought to happen.

By this point, I'd say a motion toward acceptance of homosexuality can be understood as a natural progression of our culture, as it took place over a long period of time and proceeded from our attitudes or ideals about other things. It's also grown into an expected norm of its own for some time. Gay marriage was legalized here over 20 years ago now. It was decriminalized over 50 years ago, and often decriminalization happened only after a significant shift in attitudes toward tolerance (i.e. it would remain criminal some time after normal people stopped being so vehemently against it, the laws only later changing to match those changing attitudes). It would seem to be going against the norms of society at this point if somebody wanted us to un-do the social change that has been cautiously made over the last half-century and cemented itself as mainstream opinion.

### Transgender people

Though a popular topic of conversation, this one seems like more of a cultural issue, like whether people listen to jazz music or rock and roll---not something that pertains to government policy. How do people in our society feel about transsexuals, who want to be accepted as men or women and who make reasonable steps to conform to and meet expectations? It seems like a clear majority are fine with them. And how about other sorts of people, who are nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, or otherwise breaking social norms about gendered behaviour? It seems like many people dislike it, but we're also entirely tolerant of it, as in nobody seems to think it should be illegal. A person can walk down main street with a beard and a pink dress and Canadians might make a strange face, but nobody would think to have them arrested. So what is the policy dispute here? How is it relevant to law or government?

The answer is mainly as pertains to the use of gendered public facilities, like washrooms or changerooms. This is the kind of thing that I consider a matter of public sentiment. If most women are fine with males who are transsexual women using their spaces, then very well, but otherwise there is no mandate for such a change. And as it turns out, our population generally *is* of an accepting disposition on that question, so it makes sense to have rules that reflect this.

The most controversial arena might be school curriculum. Should anybody be *taught* about trans people, or some person's ideas about gender identity, and so on? And sexuality, for that matter? I suspect there is little actual 'teaching' in some cases beyond making a brief note---e.g. to 'teach' that homosexual exists, what more does one say than tell a child "some people in our society are homosexuals, meaning they're attracted to the same gender"? There is no complicated theory they must learn and figure out how to adapt, as in other subjects; we're just sharing a fact, and probably one that we couldn't have kept them from learning outside of school anyhow.

When it comes to gender and other topics, though, things are less clear and straightforward, and we probably shouldn't be 'teaching', as though established fact, something that most people feel is still new and up in the air, which is open to change and debate, because it's not a hard science that can be proved, but to a worrying degree made up of unverifiable conjecture and statements of feeling. Wait for the dust to settle, figure out which of these ideas are actually worthwhile and which are nonsense, and have this conversation again a decade from now. That's been my attitude about it so far.

### Immigration

For policymakers, immigration is a complex balancing act. Our country may 'purchase' an instant supply of foreign labour, which is very advantageous for the economy because it gives us access to able bodies that we don't have to first birth and raise into adulthood. It's like a cheat code, an exploit, a way to skip the usual requirements, which are costly, and get right to the chase where you're putting them to work. However, this comes at the cost of internal conflict: at any given time, in any society, a significant subset of your current population tends to dislike immigrants to at least some degree, and they'll complain about it and blame things on immigrants the more of them you bring in---but it definitely benefits the economy those same people live in, so as long as it remains under control, and they feel it's a problem but not *too big* a problem, they'll get over it and things will be fine. That is the approach one would take if you were an unbiased bureaucrat whose job were to grow the economy while also maintaining political appeal, and no other real concerns or considerations.

There are some interesting questions when it comes to the international consequences of immigration programs, though. How do other countries feel about us absorbing all of their most driven, talented people? Especially if their country is poor and ours is rich. Is there injustice in that? We might feel similarly slighted if people from other countries were immigrating here only to have children and get educated, and then leaving to go somewhere else once they're qualified for work. It would be a tricky problem to solve, because what can we can do? We can't stop people from leaving. This kind of macro-level competition for control of labour is likely outside of the purview of most voting people, however.

Setting aside all pretense, I personally oppose immigration. The ideal number of immigrants is probably not zero, but it's certainly far lower than the number of immigrants who have been moving around in the world in recent decades. From 2016 to 2021, Canada took in over 1 million new immigrants. A growing number of Canadians now feel this number is too high. I am more severe than most. I'd easily to commit to saying I'd have been happier if the number were at most a tenth of that. Indeed, how much immigration has been allowed into this country is frankly outrageous. We'll probably be living with the negative social consequences of these unprecedented waves of demographic change for longer than anybody responsible for it is around to be held accountable. It seems comical that for years during this time, by the way, our immigration minister was himself an immigrant from Somalia, and he was banging the drum for *more* immigration at a time when so many people were alarmed at the height of our current numbers. I'd have told sitcom writers to be a bit more realistic.

Why does anyone dislike immigration, despite the economists and politicians telling us it makes the economy better? Do people not like better economies? We could say it's simply a dislike for people who are different, and call that racism or xenophobia. A more genuine, understanding approach is that it's about identity, culture, and belonging. As the foreign population increases, the place that used to feel like home slowly starts to feel foreign to you. There's a loss of connection, a looming sense of alienation, you begin to notice fewer and fewer people around you share your history and experiences and perspective, and you no longer fit in where once was yours. This is really what drives virtually all anti-immigration sentiment---but it's something people often don't know how to express, or feel they aren't *able* to without causing controversy, so instead they cast their feelings onto secondary issues, like concern about immigrants committing crime or driving down wages, which are often specious.

Immigrants do sometimes bring crime, and in alarming ways (people grown up outside the good values and justice system we're accustomed to), and in some industries perhaps they impose a downward impact on wages, especially if it's a sector of the economy where we have a labour shortage currently (which the workers therein would prefer to maintain)---but even if these issues are clearly solved and we have decent, law-abiding immigrants, you'll find that opposition to immigration will remain so long as the immigrants are culturally foreign and their presence changes the apparent cultural landscape of the place to which they've moved.

I've compared this, and I'm happy to continue comparing it, with the way in which we're sometimes told to accept technological changes that don't actually make us happy. It often seems like the people in charge of pushing a change become so determined to push it through they lose track of whether anybody actually wants it, or what the costs are going to be, which is precisely why a conservative attitude is so important. Imagine if somebody said, the economy will grow if we get rid of all our trees. No more trees. Or art. We can't have paintings anymore. We have to colour everything grey. And no more sunshine. We're getting rid of sunshine. And you're not going to be allowed to hear birds in the morning, or see stars at night. These things in the world that make us happy and give us psychological comfort, we're getting rid of these things---but don't worry, the economy will grow. We get rid of all these things, but in exchange, all of our business revenue will increase, the factories will make more doodads per labour hour. It'll be worth it.

There must be some point, for any person, no matter how progressive, at which you realize we can say no, and that "economic gains" aren't free. We're purchasing a bigger economy, at the expense of what it takes to achieve that. What if we'd prefer not to? What if we choose our national culture and values over the GDP growth that could be attained if we instead sacrificed our culture and values, to some extent or another? It must be spelled out in this way, because there are too many people who've come to think the policy that makes the economy bigger is the better policy, end of conversation. They don't even seem cognizant of the trade-off they've picked a side on.

I may also repeat what I said about the environment. The values and culture a population holds is a complicated thing, and the impact of sudden change can be difficult to predict. If we err and damage the country in some way, by letting in too many people or the wrong sorts of people (criminal gangs) or by letting people in and not having adequate policies to integrate them into our way of life, it can be very difficult to repair or reverse the resulting mess, because it's typically politically unpopular to deport people from a country, but also rather disrespectful to deport people after they've been here a significant length of time, and after we've made an implicit promise to offer them a new home.

It's reasonable that many of us feel some sense of obligation or duty to help people from other places fleeing war and persecution, especially if we feel that we've contributed in some way to their situation, as many people did feel about some conflicts in the Middle East a decade ago. Interestingly, I'd expect refugees more likely to act in the way I prefer from immigrants in general, which is not still being deeply connected to their previous country, but loving and embracing our country and wanting only to be one of us. I have known refugees like this from numerous countries. I'll always remember how one woman phrased it, when she told me her perspective was "this country saved me". This was somebody who truly loved and felt gratitude for Canada, and whose only desire was to be Canadian.

What I have always most disliked is when people come here and clearly, by their behaviour, view this country merely as a place to live, a resource they're using, like a hotel. They still identify more with and care more about the culture they came from, which they look back to as their real homeland. This should be your homeland now, if you want me to accept you as one of us, and not merely as a foreigner come to visit. They fly the flag of some other country, teach their children the language and history of where they came from, rather than here. They bunch together and make ethnic neighbourhoods where they keep to theirselves. I don't like it. I understand it, and in some ways I don't fault them---I should even say I can imagine myself doing the same, if I were for some reason stuck in one of *their* countries---but still I don't like it. This is simply a natural conflict between us.

### Guns

If I lived in the United States, I wouldn't favour doing anything significant about guns. I don't believe the issue of gun regulation is all that important, but trying to eliminate the gun freedom they currently have and transition their policy and attitude about guns into being more like what I'm accustomed to in Britain or Canada would likely be an impossible task. The quantity of guns already in the country is too high, and gun ownership is ingrained in American history, law, and culture, a celebrated right seemingly core to the very American identity. Could some regulation be introduced that could help reduce violent crime rates while still allowing good people access to guns? Perhaps, but I wouldn't know the details.

As for me, I have no personal affection for guns. I've never touched one, and I've never lived in a place where I see normal people walking around with them. That notion is foreign to me. Would I import the American approach to guns into my country, if I could? I've read arguments in favour of that. If civilian gun ownership became normal, it's possible certain types of crime, like muggings or home break-ins, would become rarer. However, there would also be costs. The presence of guns heightens tensions, makes escalation easier, and conflicts that could've ended with punches may instead end up with people dead with bullet wounds. Moreover, there would be a potentially very high cost of adjustment trying to introduce guns to a population that simply isn't accustomed to them. In America, people are around guns while growing up; the adults in their life know all about gun safety, they go hunting with their fathers, they go to gun ranges. We don't have that sort of gun culture in other places. In some countries if you were to suddenly put up legal gun stores in their neighbourhoods the result might well be an outbreak of gang wars and mass shootings. If you were to make that transition, it would need to be done very gradually, if at all.

So the prospect of trying to copy America's gun freedom seems risky, it seems like something that would take a long time to implement, the benefits of copying it aren't guaranteed and it may make things worse, and we also have no pressing reason to want to pursue such a change anyhow. It's not like we have an intolerable epidemic of home break-ins and we're searching for creative policy solutions. I'm most comfortable just keeping our current laws the way they are.

### Police

There is discourse about the police every so often. It comes and goes like the tide. It sometimes leads to new laws being passed and sometimes not, but we at least go through the motions of having the conversation. It begins, most times, by an instance of what appears to be police misconduct coming into our view and some people asking questions. There what is at issue is less a question of policy and more one of attitude, perception, and bias. Many times over the last decade, there have been protests, riots, and street violence, driven by outrage about police action; but a good portion of the time, it turned out that action was justified, and the public either jumped to conclusions or were misled about the facts of the case. This is part of why public opinion matters. We understand it's better if people trust their police force, because this indicates or is a sign the police are functioning well; and because increased trust leads to better police interactions. But it's also important because when people are significantly biased *against* the police, it makes more likely, and exacerbates the severity of, this type of response.

I withhold judgment about news stories involving police action until after the incident has been thoroughly investigated, because it seems to me that even in America, where everybody tells me police forces are worse trained and more abusive than in other Western countries, the police turn out to be in the right far more often than they turn out to be in the wrong---which makes sense, if we remember that most of the people that police members end up in conflict with are criminals. Even when police do kill somebody and we later decide it was unjustified, it's worth remembering this is one police member among many, as part of one police interaction among thousands, in a system that can't reasonably be expected to operate perfectly. The police have to manage a lot of risk and navigate an environment of constantly changing and unknown variables---and sometimes, the right decision is going to be that they have to shoot somebody, because their line of work frequently involves having to interact with people who want to kill them.

There's nothing unreasonable about requesting that police forces be held to standards and that misconduct be punished. To do their job as intended, police members are necessarily authorized to do things that ordinary citizens are not, and with that power comes responsibility and oversight. The popularization of police body cameras seems simple yet brilliant, as a way to, by one simple measure, prevent police misconduct, make it easier to detect and punish when it happens, and in this way increase transparency and trust with the general public.

Though pushed with good intentions, the sad irony of anti-police sentiment is that it's often harmful most of all to the very communities it's thought to help, which is low-income areas with a lot of crime. The simple reality is that more police presence means less crime and increased safety for normal people, and most of the normal people who live in dangerous, crime-ridden areas understand this.

### Riots

The idea that riots are the voice of the unheard was supposed to refer to people who didn't have legal voting rights. That's why they were 'unheard'. What is the excuse today? They're often the voice of people who have very much been heard already, but whom most people in society still disagree with, or who don't have a coherent demand anyway---and many more people who are just happy for an excuse to go out and smash windows and steal from luxury shops.

I have seen instances of police misconduct (e.g. the [UC Davis student protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Davis_pepper_spray_incident), the murder of George Floyd, the [killing of Eric Garner](https://www.billoreilly.com/b/What-the-Eric-Garner-Case-Says-about-America/655510874012086812.html)), but usually not at riots. In many cases our police have been incredibly restained, likely afraid of bad press or chaotic situations getting out of control. In particular, I recall being irritated at how patient the government was willing to be in 2022, when the 'convoy' trucker protest gathered in Ottawa. Those people completely obstructed normal citizens' use of their own city, laid on their horns for hours on end while close to residentials areas, and eventually escalated to even blocking off highways and bridges. The actual residents of Ottawa were harrassed, intimidated, assaulted. Was this the voice of the people? No. Only a segment of the people who were angrier than average. The response was probably slow because the city police weren't prepared for, and didn't have the resources to address, a situation involving so many people. The federal government was probably hesitant because they worried about how it might look to crack down on a protest. But after letting that insanity go on for weeks, I was among the people hoping the police would just roll through and arrest these idiots. I was pleased when it finally happened.

To be sure, you have a protected, celebrated right to protest in this country, but to engage in protest doesn't mean that all other laws disappear. If you start killing people as part of your protest and you get arrested for murder, this doesn't mean your right to protest has been revoked. The protesters in this case were fairly informed about the laws they were breaking, and they were instructed to stop, and they refused. They chose to be defiant, many of them probably hoping to eventually be arrested. There was so much misinformation that came about as a result of these protests that I intend on writing longer posts dedicated solely to this topic in the future.

### The military

In some communities, support for the military is less divisive than support for the police because the military doesn't have an antagonistic relationship with the domestic population. Your country's soldiers don't pull you over and give you tickets, or break into your home and arrest you. For other people, however, the military is even worse than the police, because they go to other countries and wage war in our name, and consume even more of our resources in doing so.

In either case, I should offer to your consideration: there can be no society without the organization of force, and somebody has to be the person who applies that force. Who's going to do it? Not me, if I have any say in the matter. I am accustomed to a wholly nonviolent life, here in the shade of protection created by institutions like the police and military. For that, I owe my banks to the people who put their lives on the line serving in those positions.

### International policy

I favour maintaining the current liberal world order, led by US economic and military hegemony. A requirement for this is maintaining the American military size and strength, so it's able to apply pressure against its adversaries. I'm very much against people who criticize Western powers as though the alternative is a world in which there is no imperialism, no espionage, no war, etc., rather than a world that is simply led by other powers instead of our current ones. Even if you believe the American military has done immoral things, it's a bulwark against the military power of other countries, like Russia, China, Iran, etc., whose morals, and values in general, are even worse. "None of the above" is not an option in politics: if we withdraw, somebody else will expand. Choose good over evil (even if you insist on calling good "the lesser evil").

Beware anybody who advocates for isolationism, or for abandoning our position in the world, under the guise of being "anti-war". This is the same element in society that would've had the Anglosphere stay out of World War II and allow Hitler to take over Europe without contest, as though simply none of our business. Remember: any war can be ended at any point in time, if we unconditionally surrender to our enemies. War is not the worst case scenario. It's the second worst, behind the triumph of your enemies. To be anti-war is akin to being anti-chemotherapy.

There are multiple international conflicts happening at any point in time around the world, but some are more important than others for people who live outside of the local areas involved. For example, if Venezuela were to annex the territory disputed between itself and Guyana, which of the two countries ends up winning that dispute could be very important and consequential for people who live in the area, but for me, who lives elsewhere in the world, it probably doesn't matter. I likely couldn't tell the difference between the timeline in which Venezuela wins and the one in which Guyana does. For how much attention it gets, the war between Israel and Hamas is, by this point, similarly inconsequential for people outside of that region. The most important conflict in the world today is, by far, the war in Europe between Russia and Ukraine, which is also serving as a test of the Western alliance.

### Economics

I often feel most of the time I've spent reading about economics has been wasted because nearly every person I encounter who has opinions of the topic has derived those opinions wholly from their political attitudes and never the other way around. They decide what they want---whether subsidies or lower taxes, or increased social programs and tax revenue, or something else, less regulation, more regulation---and the economic theory or justification for the things they want comes later. Very few people bother to learn about economics for its own sake, to determine what to advocate for. They go in already knowing their goals, and the field is so divided against itself that you can find some book or another to justify whatever your positions already were. This may be true to some extent for other topics as well, but it is most so for economics, where you can find somebody with credentials to vouch for any position you want, and falsification is virtually impossible, which is why there is hardly any consensus to speak of and even the people who *do* pursue economics for its own sake (professional economists who go to university and get economics degrees) all disagree with each other and constantly get things wrong---or maybe they don't get anything wrong, and the prediction you thought was wrong wasn't really because even though an economist said that because of this policy the rate of that thing would go up and instead it went down, maybe it would've gone even *more* down if not for that policy. We can never run trials or isolate variables, so nothing is ever satisfactorily disproved and dismissed---people can hang onto any economic idea they like indefinitely, if there is political will for it.

There are a few core things everybody serious agrees on, but it's more abstract than telling us what our tax rates should be, or anything like that. Rent controls and tariffs being harmful to the economy is more or less a clear consensus, for example. It's kind of like nobody can agree what food is good, but there is a consensus about some foods being bad. That's mainly the value that knowledge of economics brings to policy discussion: being able to explain why some policies have organizational costs that aren't obvious to people at first.

Here is, roughly, my attitude about the economy: it seems fine as it is. The "liberal capitalism with regulations and some social safety nets" model that we've ended up with in every Western country seems like an acceptable compromise about how to run society in a way that allows individuals to make businesses and pursue success while having limits on what they can do set by the government and there being support systems for people who fall on hard times. We don't really know of a better paradigm for production than this. In conclusion, I don't actually have any particularly interesting opinions about the economy, but I have the opinion that most other people don't either, and that most discourse about economics is rather fruitless.
