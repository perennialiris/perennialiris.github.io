# Normalization and status quo bias | 2025-04-20

There have been numerous different examples of this, but the one I remember was about bans on smoking in restaurants. If you surveyed people about it, everybody thought it was a terrible idea; but then after the ban was pushed into law, public sentiment shifted instantly, even before it came into effect. It's an example of various cognitive biases, among which is a *status quo bias* or *systemic justification bias*, but which could perhaps better be described as *making peace with the stuff you can't change*. When it was still just a proposal, people opposed the change because they saw no need for it and change is bad; but once it became law, and it felt like the deed was done and there was no longer anything they could do about it, people shrugged and just made peace with the law as is. "Now that there's no longer anything I can do to stop it, it doesn't seem so bad. Maybe it's even good." And then we go back to our lives.

This was a political point in disguise---perhaps not the best of disguises, but a bit of one. Some light makeup. In the first term, after everybody expected Mrs. Clinton to become US president, the institutional opposition to Trump was high because he was viewed as a mistake, an aberration, an anomaly, a temporary glitch in the system. Just resist for four years, or just wait a couple years for the Dems to take back the House, and things will return to normal. That's what we need, a return to normality. Or as the Americans say, 'normalcy' (imagine me shuddering slightly). The political establishment, including the Republican Party, all of the media, the big companies, our tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, it felt like everybody was aligned against him. Hey, remember when Twitter was left-wing?

It's been ten years now. Ten long years ago, Trump became the frontrunner of the Republican Party, and he's been there ever since. He was president, during which he was strangely popular with his supporters despite all his ineptitude and failings. Then he remained popular even while out of office, his voice being one everybody on the American right looked to and amplified. When the Party was choosing its 2024 candidate, Trump didn't even bother showing up to the debates, and all conversation was centred around him, he led in the polls, and then he easily won the nomination. Then he won the Presidency, this time by more than he did in 2016. This is not a temporary aberration. An anomaly, perhaps, but not one that you can simply wait out. This is our new normal. This is the Republican Party. It's been ten years and it's still not going away.

This is where our status quo bias starts to kick in. This is where people start just making peace with the things they can't stop. And I don't mean it just started activating yesterday---it's more like we're noticing the effects of it now, and his election win was a fork in the road between a big sigh of relief and all these biases finally cementing into a sort of defeated embrace. All those things you said about Trump years ago were true, and if anything it's all been even worse than you anticipated---but all these people coming to watch your stuff, or buy your products, or whatever, all the normal people in society who aren't in the trenches of political bickering? Half of them probably support it. And if you spend every other day telling them about the fascist cancer that's metastasizing in your system, they're not going to jump on board and agree with you, they're just going to roll their eyes and feel alienated. And now even the people who do agree with you don't want you to keep going on about it---they're exhausted, they don't know what they can do about it, and they just want to hear about something less depressing before they go back to work.

This is how I interpret what's going on with **Bill Maher** recently. He went [to the White House and had dinner with Trump](https://thehill.com/homenews/5220205-bill-maher-trump-dinner/) for some reason, then [went on his show and tried to tell everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxlopbcfXpQ) about how Trump was actually a gracious host who is less crazy in private than when speaking to the cameras. Was this really a surprising insight, or something he and everybody else couldn't have assumed? Why does it even matter? Maher went from sounding the alarms to making peace, from wanting to resist to acclimating and telling himself it's not so bad now that it's out of his hands. Trump is a brazen criminal who's leading an assault on the press, the courts, and the universities, who's illegally disappearing people into other country's prisons without any criminal charges or trial in order to circumvent laws he doesn't feel like following at home. But yes, tell us more about how he's not as crazy as we think because he laughed at your jokes. And he feigns ignorance at why people reacted negatively.

I feel a certain disgust when I see non-political media---the kind of stuff that normally covers celebrities and gossip and such---sharing about random slice-of-life updates or social media posts from the children and grandchildren of these people, like they're new American royal families. Hey, did you know that Trump's grandchildren make dresses in their spare time? Did you know that Elon Musk's kid is learning Chinese? I don't give a fuck. I could care less only in that my care value could be further into the negatives than it already is. They don't deserve this kind of mundane normalization. (I don't know if those two examples are true. I think they're not. I made them up because I'm deliberately trying to forget anything I may have accidentally learned about their family.)

The Trump admin illegally deported hundreds of people without any due process and is deliberately doing nothing in response to courts telling them this is illegal and they have to facilitate these people's return and give them due process, including opportunity to make habeas corpus challenges. In one case, Kilmar Garcia, [the government said the person was deported in error](https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-deportation-maryland-man-trump-error-818a0fa1218de714448edcb5be1f7347), but they still refuse to do anything about it because they don't care and none of us can do anything about it, so tough. Some person is currently in a terrorist confinement prison in some other country for no reason beyond that he looked like an immigrant and [when the Supreme Court told them to facilitate his return](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/supreme-court-trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia.html), they ignored him. In this way, Trump is instilling fear in the American population while pushing the envelope on what he can get away with, setting the precedent that he doesn't have to listen to the courts when it comes to going after his targets.

Meanwhile, Trump is defunding research universities for some reason, using antisemitism (that he doesn't care about) as an excuse to go after anybody he feels oppose him using any leverage he can find. In the case of Harvard, he says he's going to [take away federal funding and tax-exempt status](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01y9gkdm3o) unless they satisfy terms [sent to them in a letter outlining](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/14/us/trump-harvard-demands.html), among other things, how they must commit to reporting students to the US government who are 'hostile to American values' and allowing the government to audit every course and program at the school, and they're trying to bring in some kind of outside agency into the University for them to answer to. In this way, Trump is trying to assert control of higher learning and, as it pertains to [the PR threat of those pesky student protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_pro-Palestinian_protests_on_university_campuses), of what ideas, values, and speech is acceptable in public discourse (one of the people [they illegally deported, Mahmoud Khalil](https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-mahmoud-khalil-ice-15014bcbb921f21a9f704d5acdcae7a8), was targeted because he participated in political protests at Columbia University).

Not too long ago (as in, only about a month ago), Trump [started going after major law firms](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/06/trump-security-clearance-steele-dossier-025203), banning them from having any contracts with people connected to government and banning all of their employees from access to any government buildings---unless they agree to abolish their own diversity policies and make a public declaration about how they support ideological diversity, which apparently was code for them [committing to doing millions of dollars in free labour](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/20/white-house-law-firm-sanctions-026866) for the administration and initiatives of Trump's choosing. Trump, pleased with this capitulation, then [ordered his AG to continue going after law firms](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/) to try and extort them in this way. In this way, Trump is not only chilling the legal world by giving law firms cause to fear opposing him, but expanding his own legal power.

Trump has meanwhile brazenly engaged in the most personally-enriching corruption scheme of any US president ever, possible of any politician in general [by promoting a 'meme coin' to his supporters](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386) that does nothing other than allow you to speculate on it, granting himself a huge share of the initial holding that's now [valued at billions of dollars](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/donald-trump-crypto-billionaire), and which by its nature provides anybody in the world a way to anonymously bribe Trump and there's nothing we can do about it. Then, in addition to the big companies 'donating' over 100 million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund, there's surely a crazy amount of [insider trading happening right](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/donald-trump-ignites-insider-trading-accusations-after-global-tariffs-u-turn) now during the chaos about Trump's various on-again, off-again tariff policies, which nobody is going to get in trouble for because the organ of government responsible for investigating and punishing them would be, oh, right, the Trump administration.

These aren't even the only stupid, crazy, authoritarian things happening right now. We don't live in normal times. And I have grown increasingly dissatisfied with anybody who engages in normalization and wants us to just shrug and roll over and pretend like everything is fine when it's not.
