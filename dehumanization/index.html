# Dehumanization

^2024-12-12

I have a policy of restricting *dehumanization*. What is this and why am I against it?

To dehumanize somebody is

* to reduce their status, implicitly or explicitly, to something lesser than our fellow man;
* to lower them to the level of a passive object or animal;
* to imply they don't have their own feelings, wants, or needs worthy of consideration or empathy;
* to imply they're not making choices in same way that you or I might, but cannot help theirselves, or that they're only carrying things out mechanically, like a robot or lower animal;
* to imply they're undeserving of the most basic rights or considerations we typically afford all humanity.

It's more than a coincidence that dehumanization is historically connected with actual political violence and genocide. It's like somebody figured out an exploit in how our minds process other beings, if you remove from people that most essential identity of being *our fellow human*.

The process of dehumanization can take many forms and exists to many different degrees. Examples that come to mind include:

* In the Nazi regime, Jews and other minority groups were called [subhuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch), portrayed as [rodents or other vermin](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/sturm28.htm).
* In the Soviet Union, class traitors known as 'kulaks' were called [parasites, vampires, or leeches](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/sturm28.htm), among other things.
* The Indigenous peoples of North America were called [untamed creatures](https://web.archive.org/web/20071209193251/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm) and [merciless savages](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/americas-twofold-original-sin/606163/), not rising to the level of civilized Europeans.
* In the years leading up to the Rwandan genocide, the Tutsi people were [called snakes and cockroaches](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/rwanda-shows-how-hateful-speech-leads-violence/587041/), before militia groups ran through the territory, killing hundreds of thousands.

Dehumanizing language and imagery obscures the reality of what is being done. Suddenly we're not murdering other humans---only *exterminating the vermin*, *putting down an animal*, or *cleansing our country of filth*. This perverse abstraction is how people who want to employ violence may circumvent the natural resistance we all feel to inflicting suffering onto others---like how the Nazis started using gas chambers instead of shooting their victims, to lessen the psychological toll the latter had on their own soldiers.

Viktor Kravchenko, a Soviet army captain reflecting on the role he played in Stalin's purges, explained that "to spare yourself mental agony, you veil unpleasant truths from view by half-closing your eyes, and your mind." Krevchenko later defected to the West.

**Not all comparisons with non-human entities are dehumanizing.** To dehumanize somebody means more than simply comparing them with something non-human. We make comparisons with non-human things to evoke certain qualities---like calling somebody a pig to mean they're rude, or calling a lady a fox to imply she's attractive.

The question is whether the intention or consequence of the comparison is to imply the target thereof is lesser in a dehumanizing way. That's the case with some comparisons, but not others, and the same comparison can be dehumanizing in one context but not in another.

For example: if somebody in modern America says you're a snake, the meaning is most likely to suggest that you're a treacherous or dishonest person. I wouldn't call this dehumanizing. But in the Cambodian genocide, when the government was encouraging people to slaughter their class enemies, and those enemies were called snakes, that probably *was* dehumanizing, likening them to a threatening, emotionless animal to make it easier to process attacking them. So the critical detail isn't whether a non-human thing is evoked, but what it's being evoked *for*.

There are many phrases that can be dehumanizing, or can accidentally have a dehumanizing effect on the listener, even if not used with that intent. In the [Wikipedia entry on dehumanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization#Language), the term 'illegal alien' is mentioned as an example of language that can be dehumanizing---but that term is so normal that I wouldn't accuse somebody who says it of *trying *to dehumanize others.

However, I'm willing to reflect on how 'alien' how in modern times come to be associated primarily with non-human lifeforms from outer space, which are *sometimes* of a human-level intellect but sometimes not, and so even though I might not restrict others' use of this term, it's worth considering using other, better, more thoughtful language instead. And I encourage other people to engage in this kind of self-reflection.

The instances of dehumanization I most often encounter online are attacks against political identities, racial groups, poor people, and migrants. There's a pattern in right-wing spaces to carelessly dehumanize the far-left. There's even a popular quote I see circulate every so often by a Polish mercenary named Rafa≈Ç Gan-Ganowicz, who supposedly said he didn't know what it feels like to take a human life because he's only ever killed communists. I'm not sure whether it's a genuine quote or not, but you can appreciate the meaning other way: the lives of Russian soldiers he killed are unimportant or trivial because of their political affiliation, or, in practice, just their nationality.

But dehumanization isn't limited to extremists or online forums. It's something we see public figures engage in. In recent years, it's been applied to refugees, depicting them as rats, ants, or various non-human primates. In Europe, this is applied especially to black people and Muslims. In the US, it's sometimes applied to Latin Americans, though less frequently. It's also come up in the Israel--Palestine conflict, where Islamist terror groups are likened to animals or said to be less than human.

* Trump in 2018 said ["These aren't people, these are animals"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/us/politics/fact-check-trump-animals-immigration-ms13-sanctuary-cities.html) about some Mexicans in the United States.
* Israeli defense minister [Yoav Gallant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant) in 2023 said ["We are fighting against animals"](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-defense-minister-human-animals-gaza-palestine_n_6524220ae4b09f4b8d412e0a), referring to people in Gaza.
* [Zsolt Bayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsolt_Bayer) wrote in 2015 [describing migrants as hordes of "wild animals"](https://www.magyarhirlap.hu/velemeny/Elkerulhetetlen).

In some cases you can understand a person's motivation (e.g. somebody experiences deep personal loss at the hands of another group) but still recognize that it's better if we avoid language and framing like this. It is, *at best*, still not good.

Another group that's often targeted is criminals. When a person does a terrible crime, the reaction is often that we feel anger toward them, and some people will then resort to dehumanization. This is still improper and should be avoided. The great test of the morality of a nation is how it treats people who are at its mercy, including people who are now imprisoned for doing something terrible. Whether violent extremists, terrorists, serial killers, fascists, pedophiles, or something else, criminals and broadly 'bad' people are still people, and how we treat them matters.

I don't demand everybody be nice and polite at all times, but I do think we can try to foster a culture where we're more conscientious about how we communicate and treat one another. Think about your language and what implications you may incidentally be carrying or contributing to. We can often do better than the bare minimum that platform rules require of us.
