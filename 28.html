# The problem with Pierre | 2025-03-15

The Conservative Party of Canada was deciding what it wanted to be after Harper. Andrew Scheer was leader from '17 to '20, then he stepped down and the party elected Erin O'Toole, who was outsted in early 2022, the Party seemingly dissatisfied with him after their performance in the [2021 snap election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Canadian_federal_election). Mr. O'Toole had been elected Party leader in the third round of a run-off election, a compromise candidate was nobody's first choice. Though a tolerable and experienced man, he was criticized from within the Party for being too moderate.

In the ensuing debate, **Pierre Poilievre** promised to take the party in a less moderate direction. Jean Charest, a long-time Conservative politician who was also running for the Party leadership, criticized Poilievre for supporting the controversial [Convoy protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest), ongoing in Ottawa---but Poilievre didn't shy away from the issue, he leaned into it, turning around and criticizing Charest for "repeating Liberal lies about truckers" and for being too coöperative with the Liberal agenda, putting a spotlight on his support for a consumer carbon tax. Poilievre won, and has been the Conservative Party leader from then til now.

I have been dissatisfied with how things have progressed in the Conservative Party over the last few years under Poilievre's tenure as Opposition Leader. Poilievre is perhaps a good media strategist and demagogue, but he is not what Canada should be looking for in a leader. We may have some disagreements in policy, but even more visceral is my dislike of his manner of personal attacks, and the dishonest nature of his conduct in trying to take down Justin Trudeau.

In this post, I'll go over some examples of what I mean.

### The passport kerfuffle

The Canadian passport, like most country's passports, is periodically updated to add security features and change its design, as happened again in 2023. I didn't love the redesign---each version has various faded images in the background of the pages, and the previous version had depictions of significant things from Canadian history, whereas [the 2023 design has more contemporary, nature-focused imagery](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-new-passport-more-nature-fewer-history-1.6838308) of people skiing, leaves, wildlife, and things like that. I looked over a number of comparisons, and I preferred the previous one. But is it a big deal? No. It is so much *not* a big deal that it's comical we're still talking about it.

The passport redesign has nothing to do with the Prime Minister. It doesn't require the PM's approval, and everybody knows this, including Poilievre. Speaking in May 2023, Sean Fraser, then-Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, said the new design was "the result of 10 years of consultation" that suggested people liked celebrating Canada's natural environment. Among the images used in the previous passport that were not featured in the newest version was a depiction of the Vimy Ridge Memorial. The Royal Canadian Legion, our largest veterans' support organization, said they were sad to see it go.

Thoughts or criticism about the design change are one thing. Poilievre could've said it's a reflection of our changing values as a nation, how it's becoming less fashionable to acknowledge and celebrate history, instead focusing on things intended to be less controversial. Instead Mr. Poilievre decided to pretend that the passport change was Mr. Trudeau's doing, and then speculate and attack him personally for it.

>"[T]he current Prime Minister's woke and out-of-touch ideology is so egotistical that he cannot imagine there are any Canadian stories bigger than him. That is why he deleted Terry Fox, the soldiers who died at Vimy, the city of Quebec and the RCMP from our passport to replace them with a colouring book that includes an image of him swimming at Harrington Lake when he was a boy."[](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-195/hansard)
"Why is he deleting the 3,598 Canadians who gave their lives so that Canada could have freedom and victory at Vimy? He is erasing them and with that, he is insulting all of our veterans."[](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-new-passport-more-nature-fewer-history-1.6838308)
"Justin Trudeau wants to cancel our proud history, erasing it from our passports. Our great military triumphs, gone. The [famous five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five_(Canada\)), who secured women's rights, gone. Even Terry Fox had to go. Why? Because there can be no heroes but him. So he replaced these images in our passport with an image of himself swimming as a boy at Harrington Lake, and pictures of snowflakes, in honour of members of his Liberal cabinet."[](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-policy-convention-transgender-1.6961991)
"This business of deleting our past must end. And this is a matter on which English Canada must start to learn from Quebec. Quebeccers, and I'm saying this deliberately in English, do not apologize for their culture, their language, and their history. They celebrate it. And all Canadians should do the same."[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udjqw5YuzKI)
--- Pierre Poilievre

This all reminds me of when the American president blamed Trudeau for [the CBC cutting his brief cameo from a daytime airing of *Home Alone 2*](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/26/politics/home-alone-trump-justin-trudeau/index.html). Some people argued that was a joke, because there's always plausible deniability in those circles. Poilievre was not joking.

Poilievre is well aware it makes no sense to blame this on Trudeau. The problem is he doesn't care and makes these attacks anyway. He sacrifices truth for rhetorical effectiveness.

Even if Trudeau *had* been in charge of the passport redesign, to say he is egotistical and trying to 'delete' our history by no longer having it in the backdrop of a passport would still be unjustified. *Someone* made these decision to approve these changes, meaning Poilievre's description applies to *someone*---and whoever that was doesn't deserve this insulting narrative.

The casual dishonesty, speculative personal insults, and divisive, incendiary phrasing meant to falsely imply that our head of government wants to erase our history and make us apologize for our culture---this is all unbecoming of somebody who wants to represent us.

### The CBC and Twitter

In 2023, Twitter changed its policy regarding state-run outlets controlled by governments like Russia, Iran, or China---instead of shadow-banning them, they would be allowed to participate but were labelled "state-affiliated media". This was to indicate their bias and agenda for readers, because these aren't independent journalists; they are mouthpieces for the Russian and Chinese regimes. Twitter then also labelled Western publicly-funded outlets like NPR and the CBC as "government-funded media".

This was misleading, albeit technically true---these organizations don't take any editorial direction from their governments, and as such their content doesn't have the same sort of bias that readers need to be warned about. Labelling them in this way could send the wrong message to readers. It was later also noted that Twitter's own policy defined the label as being for agencies whose content direction may have varying degrees of government involvement, which these companies denied.

The CBC [stated](https://x.com/CBCRadioCanada/status/1648033861152960531) "Our journalism is impartial and independent. To suggest otherwise is untrue", and said they would stop using Twitter entirely as a result of the label.

Twitter later [removed these labels](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/twitter-changes-tags-1.6817729)---but not before Poilievre noticed and celebrated. The Conservative Party, like other right-wing parties these days, would be happy to get rid of public utilities like the CBC and have society rely entirely on right-wing alt-media on the internet instead.

Poilievre [wrote, also on Twitter, that](https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1647750040142876674) the CBC had been "**officially exposed as 'government-funded media'**" and that "**now people know it is Trudeau propaganda, not news**."

What on Earth is Poilievre meaning when he says it was "exposed"? As though anything new had been revealed? We all know the CBC is a Crown Corporation that receives public funding. Why is Poilievre acting as though Twitter had taught us anything? The implication of his phrasing is even that it revealed something *damning*. It hadn't. Twitter merely repeated (distorted) common knowledge.

The description "Trudeau propaganda, not news" is even more absurd. Trudeau has no direction over the CBC. Poilievre is implicitly telling the public that the CBC is not an independent agency nor even "news" but propaganda, that it's appropriate to think of it on the same level of state propaganda as Russia's RT or the Chinese CGTN? Poilievre knows rather well that all of this is false.

He also takes the opportunity to link to a petition to defund the CBC. This has been a political goal of the Conservative Party in recent years. There isn't something inherently damning about that. It's a disagreement I would have with him, as I think now more than ever public broadcasters have become an important service to maintain. But it's troubling that the Conservatives must apparently resort to these dishonest tactics in order to push that narrative and try and turn the public against the CBC.

### Poilievre the showman

Poilievre, [speaking in the House in April 2024, asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ulI_n-NqcI): "When will we put an end to this wacko policy by this wacko prime minister?" Speaker of the House, Greg Fergus, stood and said this was not acceptable and asked the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw his unparliamentary language.

For anybody who's not familiar, the Speaker is the presiding officer of a session of Parliament, and he or she has broad authority in that role to preside over debate, facilitate the asking and answering of questions, and maintain general order and decorum of the House. Typically nobody argues with them and certainly nobody tries to question their authority. It's like trying to fight the ref.

||indent
**House Speaker, Greg Fergus:** "I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition to withdraw that term, which is not considered parliamentary."
**Opposition Leader, Pierre Poilievre:** "Mr. Speaker, I replace wacko with extremist. He is an extremist."
**Fergus:** "I'm going to ask the leader of the opposition once again to just withdraw that comment, please. And I'll invite the honourable member to... I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition to please withdraw that comment, and simply withdraw that comment."
**Poilievre:** "I'll replace it with radical. That's his policy."
**Fergus:** "I am not asking to replace. I am asking the honourable member to just simply withdraw."
**Poilievre:** "Mr. Speaker, I replace the word wacko with extremist."
**Fergus:** "I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition one last time to please withdraw that comment, and *simply* withdraw that comment."
**Poilievre:** "I simply withdraw and replace with the aforementioned adjective."
**Fergus:** "Mr. Poilievre, I have to name you for disregarding the authority of the chair, pursuant to the authority granted to me by standing order 11. I order you to withdraw from the House and from any participation by video conference for the remainder of this day's sitting."

The other Conservative MPs left with him in solidarity.

Poilievre is not uninformed about how Parliament works. He was given numerous chances and dared the Speaker to act, which he did. It was a deliberately childish play, to either push the envelope and wear away at our norms of civility, or---if stopped---to play the victim and make a show out of the Speaker finally having to remove him for his pointless lack of coöperation.

"Wacko" is not even the worst of what Poilievre has called Trudeau and other Liberal members. His language has been increasingly extreme and insulting, to a degree very much outside of the norm for Canadian politics, and certainly beyond anything that Trudeau says about him, or any of his other political opponents---publicly calling Trudeau an **extremist**, a **radical**, and [in at least one instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4nhifpVftA) he even called him a **Marxist**; as well as simply making personal insults, calling him **weak**, an **embarrassment**, and a **narcissist**.

I don't approve of this kind of disrespectful conduct. In addition to being wrong to the point of just being silly (nobody serious could think of Trudeau as an extremist much less a Marxist), this is bringing down the quality of our political culture in an unwelcomed way.

### Woke this, woke that

Is anyone else sick of the term 'woke' yet? No, of course you are---I should be asking if you're sick of people asking you if you're sick of the term 'woke' yet, since I'm not the first person to use the line.

Whatever it may have originally meant, 'woke' has morphed into the perfect tool of propaganda in our new "attention economy". It allows people to channel many feelings for little substance, a way of saying something without really saying much of anything. It allows the listener to project onto it whatever *they* have in mind.

What does it mean for something to be woke? If I say "racism is bad", am I being woke? Maybe, maybe not. That's the magic of it, really. This is a resource Poilievre is willing and happy to tap into. He criticized the government's military policy---ambiguously, without really identifying *what* he was criticizing---by saying "this insane woke DEI obsession is driving people away; nobody wants to be part of this woke social-engineering project." Woke, woke, woke.

He once argued against a law, speaking in the House of Commons, by saying "It gives the power to a woke agency, the CRTC" (the Canadian Radio-Television Telecomm Commission).[](https://openparliament.ca/debates/2023/3/30/pierre-poilievre-2/)

"I will end that radical woke ideology," Poilievre says. I'm listening. "I will treat every single Canadian equally." Wait, is that woke? "We will cut off the funds that have gone to antisemitic groups and to other hatemongers." Wait, are we defunding things for being racist? Is that woke?

"The first thing I will do when I am Prime Minister is to bring back a warrior culture, not a woke culture. And we will be recruiting warriors to fight for this country again."[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlcuS5nwSi4)

Poilievre sounds like the governor of Florida, not somebody who wants to govern Canada. Stop it with this.

### Ukraine

I'm glad to say Poilievre has consistently been pro-Ukraine in his public statements. The Russia--Ukraine war is the most important conflict in the world right now and as such is an important question for any politician who wants to be involved in international politics. Poilievre has not fallen into the same trap as some other right-wing politicians in Western countries of being critical of Ukraine and suggesting capitulation to Russia.

However, in 2023 there was a strange incident where the Conservative Party all voted against renewing Canada's free trade agreement with Ukraine (CUFTA). Though they didn't have the votes to block it, the rationale for the move was strange: Poilievre came out afterwards and said "it speaks to how pathologically obsessed Trudeau is with the carbon tax that, while the knife is at the throat of Ukrainians, he would use that to impose his carbon tax ideology on those poor people".[](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-ukraine-poilievre-free-trade-carbon-tax-1.7038249)

There is something ironic about this. Who else was talking about carbon taxes? The [text of the agreement](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/text-texte/2023/toc-tdm.aspx?lang=eng) includes (in Chapter 13: Environment), an intent to cöoperate "bilaterally and in international forums to address matters of mutual interest", including "promot[ing] carbon pricing and measures to mitigate carbon leakage risks". There was no strict requirement being 'imposed' onto anybody, as that section of the agreement wasn't even binding nor did it make any specific requirements---and Ukraine already has a carbon tax, and has for years. So what's going on?

It's worrying when a leader's decisions simply don't appear to make any sense. Karina Gould (House leader and MP for Burlington) claimed the Conservatives were "following in the steps of right-wing American politicians who have turned their backs on Ukrainians"[](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz98J1COEWg). The US only recently had to fight to get aid for Ukraine through their legislature.

#### Here's an alternate explanation:

After we became party to the 2016 Paris Agreement, the Canadian Parliament passed the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (GHGPPA), which received royal assent in June 2018. Carbon pricing had until then been implemented provincially if at all, but this made it a federal issue. Numerous provinces appealed, arguing it wasn't the responsibility of the federal goevrnment, but the Supreme Court ruled (in 2021) that the law was constitutional.

The Conservative Party put everything they had into opposing the resulting consumer carbon tax, making it their number-one issue. Then the elections of 2019 and 2021 came and went, both resulting in a Trudeau-led government that had enough support, with the NDP, to pass legislation without any Conservative support. Back then, it seemed like the fight against the carbon tax was over, and the tax won.

But it wasn't over yet. As the cost of living climbed, as COVID and the resulting inflation came and went, as our housing market continued to be, well, bad, the Conservatives kept talking about the consumer fuel tax, because it's a particularly *visible* tax that ordinary people have to pay. Complaining about it resonates. By the time Poilievre came into his Conservative leadership position in 2022, he had locked in on this policy, seemingly considering it a major weakness of the Trudeau government, and the key to his own victory. He would campaign on his desire to "axe the tax" and brought up the GHGPPA's industrial pricing when asked about the threats of a trade war with the United States, as he said Canada's carbon taxes would make it appealing for businesses to move their operations to America instead.

The Conservative Party had no ability to block the CUFTA, meaning they were effectively just in the background while Trudeau got to be in the spotlight signing the agreement with Zelensky. Voting no and using it as an opportunity to talk about the carbon tax, despite it being substantively irrelevant, was just a political maneuver intended to shift our attention from Ukraine (an issue that helped Trudeau) back to the carbon tax (the issue that hurt Trudeau). The theory would've been simple: the more time we spend talking about the latter, the better for Poilievre.

### Security clearance

Poilievre is the only party leader in Parliament who has refused to get security clearance in order to be briefed on information pertinent to combating foreign interference in Canadian politics. He says he wants the information to be all be dumped publicly and says if he's instead made privy to classified information, there will be used against him because he won't be able to criticize the government as publicly. This comes off as suspicious because it just doesn't make any sense. It makes you wonder what his *real* reason for refusing to go through the process is. And that's not something I should even have to be thinking about.

The main theory everybody comes to is that Poilievre has something to hide: that he's already aware of certain things it would benefit him to pretend he has no knowledge of. If he receives security clearance and gets briefed on it, then he can pretend no longer. When it blows up in the future, he won't be able to plead ignorance, because he was briefed on it by CSIS. The information, and the record of it being presented to him, would force him to act now instead of later. But really, who knows. This is a trouble, albeit mysterious, aspect of Poilievre's time as Opposition Leader.

Justin Trudeau recently helped make a campaign ad [criticizing Poilievre for precisely this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvVDFdvaO3Y), but Poilievre likely won't budge, as he's been resisting this despite public pressure on him about it for a couple years now. If anything, the fact the Liberals so badly want him to do it may be causing him to dig his heels in.

### *Other notes*

- Poilievre said he would not only oppose but strictly ban any members of his cabinet from participating in the World Economic Forum. That seems fairly stupid, and kind of leaning into conspiracy theories about the WEF, which I dislike.
- He supports our legalization of marijuana, but opposes decriminalizing harder drugs. That's a reasonable stance.
- While some elements of the Conservative Party have been flirting with "anti-gender" sentiment from the US, Poilievre has mostly stayed away from it, except when reporters try and get him to talk about it. There was a moment where, in response to a question about whether trans women should be able to use female facilities, he essentially said no, and those should only be for females, not biological males. That's a little disappointing, and I think not aligned with the values of most Canadians---but even if this is something he personally feels, it's not something he's been vocal about at all, and policy about public washrooms is not in the purview of the federal government. For the most part, I doubt it's an issue.
- Earlier this year, when the Trump admin. signed an executive order declaring there's only two genders, [Poilievre was asked what his feelings were about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwfC9z4YWhs), and he said:
 "Well, I don't know. Do you have any other genders that you'd like to name? ... I'm not aware of any other genders than men and women, and I mean.. if you have any other you want me to consider, you're welcome to tell me. ... I'm only aware of two. ... As far as I'm concerned, we should have a government that just minds its own damn business and just leaves people alone to make their own personal decisions. That's the kind of government I'm going to run."
 This was a perfectly reasonable reply both in tone and content. And it's rather funny the reporter who asked didn't have a prepared answer to Poilievre's question.
- Poilievre would get thrown out of the Republican Party if he were to go to the United States. The particular blend of positions he holds would only work in Canada. He's pro-abortion, he defends our healthcare system. I don't think he wants to bring gun rights here, though he's not in favour of the government *increasing* restrictions on gun ownership from where we already are. He wants to stop guns being smuggled into the country. He takes reasonable positions on many domestic policy issues. He's not an extremist or radical. I would not characterize him as far-right. He is, in most ways, in terms of his opinions, positions, or proposals, a good representation of, or a good voice for, the right wing of Canada.
- Poilievre's reaction to Trump threatening Canada's borders, economy, and sovereignty hasn't been perfect (I don't feel saying "Canada first" was the right note), but overall it hasn't been terrible either. He advocated for retaliatory tariffs, said he would encourage intra-Canadian trade, and strongly said Canada has no intention to ever be part of Canada. That's good, basically what's required of him plus a bit more.

I suspect Poilievre embraced being the Conservative Party attack dog because he's a good speaker and quick on his feet, but that in trying to take down Trudeau, he sacrificed too much of himself, played too fast and loose with the facts, got dirty with his rhetoric. If he truly believes he's the right choice for Canada and that he's just doing what it takes to win, then he may view this behaviour as justified. But I don't.

If there were a sweeping Conservative victory, my hope would be that Poilievre's behaviour will change for the better. It's possible that as Prime Minister, he would be a new man from the one we know today as Opposition Leader. He could become more measured and unifying, more focused on governing than insulting. However, I'm not betting on it.

With all said and done, my view is that Poilievre is a demagogue, that he's not very principled, and that he's wrong for Canada. In effort to minimize the chances of the Conservative Party gaining control of the House, I'll be voting Liberal, and I hope that as many of my fellow Canadians as possible choose to do the same.

I'll do more to talk about problems with the Liberals and with our electoral system after the election.
