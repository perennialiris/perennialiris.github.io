2025-03-18 | Trump says he had a great, "very good and productive" phone call with Putin.[](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjevg23enggo) Putin made new demands, didn't agree to anything, rejected calls for a ceasefire.

[They] had no opportunity to file habeas or any type of action to challenge the removal under the AEA."[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=120094673) In some cases the deportations are based on accusations involving tattoos.[](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5341544/ice-el-salvador-jerce-reyes-barrios)

This not being the case at all and many of the targeted countries have low tariffs on the US. He also repeats that the US "subdizies" Canada, by which he simply means the US buys things from Canada.

The people deported had been confined in Texas, therefore the case should be in the Texas district court, not D.C. They insist those deported must be given time and opportunity to file habeas claims to challenge their removal. (For more, see 2025-05-01.)

The Trump admin called this deportation an administrative error.[](https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-deportation-maryland-man-trump-error-818a0fa1218de714448edcb5be1f7347) In response to the ruling, the Trump admin claimed it doesn't have jurisdiction over the El Salvador prison, but would provide a plane to the US (to 'facilitate') if El Salvador chose to release him.[](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/13/abrego-garcia-el-salvador-trump-administration-00288502)
