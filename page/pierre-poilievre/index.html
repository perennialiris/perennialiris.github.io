# Pierre Poilievre

.2025-03-15

In the post-Harper years, the Conservative Party of Canada was deciding what it wanted to be. Andrew Scheer, leader from 2017 to 2020, stepped down and the party elected Erin O'Toole, whom they ousted in early 2022, dissatisfied after not making any gains in the 2021 election. O'Toole had been elected in the third round of a run-off election, a compromise candidate who was nobody's first choice, and was criticized from within the party for being too moderate.

In the ensuing debate and leadership race, Pierre Poilievre promised to take the party in a less moderate direction. Jean Charest, also in the running for party leadership, criticized Poilievre for supporting the controversial trucker convoy protests, then ongoing in Ottawa---but Poilievre didn't shy away from the issue; he leaned into it. He turned around and criticized Charest for "repeating Liberal lies about the truckers", and for being too coöperative with the Liberal agenda, like supporting the consumer carbon tax. Poilievre went on to win the party leadership by a large margin and has been leader ever then til now.

I've been dissatisfied and concerned about the party's direction under Mr. Poilievre's leadership. He is an effective speaker, but not what this country should be looking for in a leader. I have some disagreements in policy, but more visceral is my dislike of his manner of personal attack, and the dishonest nature of his conduct in trying to take down Justin Trudeau. Here, I'll go over examples of what I mean.

# The passport kerfuffle

The Canadian passport is periodically updated to add security features and change its design. This happened again in 2023. Each version has various faded images in the background and the previous version had depictions of things in Canadian history, whereas the 2023 redesign has more contemporary, nature-focused imagery of people skiing, some leaves, wildlife, things like that. I preferred the previous one, but the change isn't a big deal either way, except insofar as you see it as a symptom of a broader problem.

The passport redesign isn't handled by the Prime Minister. In May 2023, Sean Fraser, then Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship, said the new design was the result of consultation that suggested people liked celebrating Canada's natural environment.

Criticism of the design is one thing. Poilievre could've said it's a reflection of our changing value as a nation, of how it's become less fashionable to acknowledge and celebrate history, and then engaged us on that topic. There are many who would be sympathetic. Instead, Poilievre decides to pretend as though the passport change was Mr. Trudeau's doing personally, and attack him for it in an absurd and dishonest manner:

||indent
"[T]he current Prime Minister's woke and out-of-touch ideology is so egotistical that he cannot imagine there are any Canadian stories bigger than him. That is why he deleted Terry Fox, the soldiers who died at Vimy, the city of Quebec, and the RCMP from our passport to replace them with a colouring book that includes an image of him swimming at Harrington Lake when he was a boy."[](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-195/hansard)
"Why is he deleting the 3,598 Canadians who gave their lives so that Canada could have freedom and victory at Vimy? He is erasing them and with that, he is insulting all of our veterans."[](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-new-passport-more-nature-fewer-history-1.6838308)
"Justin Trudeau wants to cancel our proud history, erasing it from our passports. Our great military triumphs, gone. The famous five, who secured women's rights, gone. Even Terry Fox had to go. Why? Because there can be no heroes but him. So he replaced these images in our passport with an image of himself swimming as a boy at Harrington Lake, and pictures of snowflakes, in honour of members of his Liberal cabinet."[](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-policy-convention-transgender-1.6961991)
"This business of deleting our past must end. And this is a matter on which English Canada must start to learn from Quebec. Quebeccers, and I'm saying this deliberately in English, do not apologize for their culture, their language, and their history. They celebrate it. And all Canadians should do the same."[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udjqw5YuzKI)
--- Pierre Poilievre

Even if Trudeau had personally ordered the passport redesign and told them to change the images to be more nature-themed, these attacks would remain absurd. There is no justification in this change to say that Trudeau is egotistical, that he wants to delete our history, or that he wants everything to be about him. No, there is no depiction of Justin Trudeau in the new passport. Poilievre is just lying about that, and he said this lie on multiple occasions.

This reminds me of when Trump publicly blamed Trudeau for the CBC cutting his brief cameo from a daytime airing of Home Alone 2. But there some people argued it was a joke. Poilievre was not joking. He knows that he's doing, he knows it isn't true and doesn't make sense, but he makes these divisive, personal attacks nonetheless. He sacrifices truth at the altar of rhetorical effectiveness.

# The CBC and Twitter

In 2023, Twitter changed its policy regarding state-run outlets controlled by governments like Russia, Iran, or China, labelling them "state-affiliated media". This was to indicate their bias for readers: they're not independent journalists, but mouthpieces for their respective regimes. Twitter then labelled Western publicly-funded outlets like NPR and the CBC the same way, then updated theirs to say "government-funded media". This was true, but misleading, especially given the timing, and could send the wrong message to readers.

The CBC issued a [statement](https://x.com/CBCRadioCanada/status/1648033861152960531), insisting their "journalism is impartial and independent. To suggest otherwise is untrue" and stopped using Twitter entirely as a result of the label. They weren't alone. Twitter later walked this back and [removed these labels](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/21/twitter-drops-state-affiliated-government-funded-labels)---but not before Poilievre noticed and celebrated, writing [on his Twitter page](https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1647750040142876674) that the CBC had been "**officially exposed as 'government-funded media'**" and that "**now people know it is Trudeau propaganda, not news**."

What on Earth is Poilievre meaning when he says it was "exposed"? As though anything new had been revealed? We all know the CBC is a Crown Corporation that receives public funding. Why is Poilievre acting like Twitter had taught us anything? The description "Trudeau propaganda, not news" is even more absurd, and people were rightly reminded of Donald Trump calling everything fake news.

He also takes the opportunity to link to a petition to defund the CBC. This has been a political goal of the Conservative Party in recent years, and it's a disagreement that I have with them, as I think now more than ever public broadcasters have become an important service to maintain, even if they have some flaws. There isn't something inherently damning about linking to a petition, but it's troubling that the Conservatives must apparently resort to these dishonest tactics to push that agenda.

# Poilievre the showman

In April 2024, Poilievre engaged in a dumb stunt after asking in the House: "When will we put an end to this wacko policy by this wacko prime minister?" Speaker of the House, Greg Fergus, [stood and said this was not acceptable, and asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ulI_n-NqcI) the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw his unparliamentary language.

||indent
**House Speaker, Greg Fergus:** "I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition to withdraw that term, which is not considered parliamentary."
**Opposition Leader, Pierre Poilievre:** "Mr. Speaker, I replace wacko with extremist. He is an extremist."
**Fergus:** "I'm going to ask the leader of the opposition once again to just withdraw that comment, please. And I'll invite the honourable member to... I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition to please withdraw that comment, and simply withdraw that comment."
**Poilievre:** "I'll replace it with radical. That's his policy."
**Fergus:** "I am not asking to replace. I am asking the honourable member to just simply withdraw."
**Poilievre:** "Mr. Speaker, I replace the word wacko with extremist."
**Fergus:** "I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition one last time to please withdraw that comment, and *simply* withdraw that comment."
**Poilievre:** "I simply withdraw and replace with the aforementioned adjective."
**Fergus:** "Mr. Poilievre, I have to name you for disregarding the authority of the chair, pursuant to the authority granted to me by standing order 11. I order you to withdraw from the House and from any participation by video conference for the remainder of this day's sitting."

The other Conservative MPs left with him in solidarity, wasting the day's remainder. Poilievre knows how Parliament works and knew he'd get thrown out if he refused. He was given numerous chances and dared the Speaker to act. It was a deliberately childish play to either push the envelope and wear away at our norms of civility, or---if stopped---to play the victim and make a show out of the Speaker finally having to remove him for his pointless lack of coöperation.

"Wacko" is not even the worst of what Poilievre has called Trudeau and other Liberal members. His language has been increasingly extreme and insulting, to a degree very much outside of the norm for Canadian politics, and certainly beyond anything that Trudeau says about him, or any of his other political opponents---publicly calling Trudeau an **extremist**, a **radical**, and [in at least one instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4nhifpVftA) he even called him a **Marxist**; as well as simply making personal insults, calling him **weak**, an **embarrassment**, and a **narcissist**.

This conduct degrades our political culture. In addition, it's wrong to the point of being ridiculous. I don't think anybody could in good conscience say that Trudeau is an extremist, or a radical, and he's very much not a Marxist or Communist. This is fearmongering, and dishonest fearmongering at that.

# Woke this, woke that

Whatever it may have originally meant, *woke* has morphed into the perfect tool of propaganda in our new "attention economy". It allows people to channel many feelings for little substance, a way of saying something without really saying much of anything---but it's rhetorically effective, because it allows the listener to project onto it whatever *they* have in mind.

What does it mean for something to be woke? If I say "racism is bad", am I being woke? Maybe, maybe not. That's the magic of it, really. And this is a resource Poilievre is willing and happy to tap into. For example:

* He [recently criticized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlcuS5nwSi4) the government's military policy---ambiguously, without really identifying *what* he was criticizing---by saying "this insane woke DEI obsession is driving people away; nobody wants to be part of this woke social-engineering project."
* He once argued against a law, [speaking in the House of Commons, by saying](https://openparliament.ca/debates/2023/3/30/pierre-poilievre-2/) "It gives the power to a woke agency, the CRTC" (the Canadian Radio-Television Telecomm Commission).
* He [recently said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlcuS5nwSi4) "the first thing I will do when I am Prime Minister is to bring back a warrior culture, not a woke culture. And we will be recruiting warriors to fight for this country again."
* In one instance, Poilievre [said, one sentence after the other](https://youtu.be/wESVu15VUic?t=1403): "I will end that radical woke ideology. I will treat every single Canadian equally. We will cut off the funds that have gone to antisemitic groups and to other hatemongers." So we're defunding things for being racist? Is that not woke?

Poilievre's utilization of this nonsense is a red flag. He sounds like he wants to govern Florida, not Canada.

# Ukraine

I'm happy to say Poilievre has consistently been pro-Ukraine in his public statements. The Russia--Ukraine war is the most important conflict in the world right now and as such is an important question for any politician who wants to be involved in international politics. Poilievre has not fallen into the same trap as some other right-wing politicians in Western countries of being critical of Ukraine and suggesting capitulation to Russia.

However, in 2023 there was a strange incident where the Conservative Party all voted against renewing Canada's free trade agreement with Ukraine (CUFTA). Though they didn't have the votes to block it, the rationale for the move was strange: [Poilievre came out afterwards and said](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-ukraine-poilievre-free-trade-carbon-tax-1.7038249) "it speaks to how pathologically obsessed Trudeau is with the carbon tax that, while the knife is at the throat of Ukrainians, he would use that to impose his carbon tax ideology on those poor people". A carbon tax ideology? What's a carbon tax ideology?

There is something ironic about this. Who else was talking about carbon taxes? The [text of the agreement](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/text-texte/2023/toc-tdm.aspx?lang=eng) includes (in Chapter 13: Environment), an intent to cöoperate "bilaterally and in international forums to address matters of mutual interest", including "promot[ing] carbon pricing and measures to mitigate carbon leakage risks". There was no strict requirement being 'imposed' onto anybody, as that section of the agreement wasn't even binding nor did it make any specific requirements (it was more a statement of intent)---and Ukraine already has a carbon tax, and has for years. So what's going on?

It's concerning when a leader's decisions don't appear to make any sense. Karina Gould [wrote on Instagram her opinion that](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz98J1COEWg) Conservatives were "following in the steps of right-wing American politicians who have turned their backs on Ukrainians".

Here's an alternate explanation: After we became party to the 2016 Paris Agreement, the Canadian Parliament passed the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (GHGPPA), which received royal assent in June 2018. Carbon pricing had until then been implemented provincially if at all, but this made it a federal issue. The Conservative Party opposed the resulting consumer carbon tax, but the elections of 2019 and 2021 came and went, both resulting in a Trudeau-led government. Back then it seemed like the fight was over, and the carbon tax won.

But it wasn't over yet. Poilievre kept the issue centre stage, and as the cost of living climbed, as our housing market got worse, and as the pandemic and the resulting inflation came and went, the Conservatives kept on talking about the consumer fuel tax. And it resonated with people because it's a particularly *visible* tax ordinary people had to pay. Poilievre campaigned everywhere on his desire to "axe the tax" and brought up the GHGPPA's industrial pricing when asked about threats of a trade war, as carbon taxes could make it appealing for companies to move operations to America instead.

The Conservative Party had no ability to block the CUFTA, meaning they were effectively sidelined while Trudeau got to be in the spotlight signing the agreement with Zelensky. Voting no (knowing it would pass anyway) and using that vote as an opportunity to talk about the carbon tax, despite it being substantively irrelevant, was just a political maneuver intended to shift our attention from Ukraine (an issue that helped Trudeau) back to the carbon tax (the issue that hurt Trudeau). The more time we spend talking about the latter, the better for Poilievre.

That's what I think happened, anyway. How you feel about this is up to you, but that ordeal made him look worse in my eyes.

# Security clearance

Poilievre is the only party leader in Parliament who has refused to get security clearance in order to be briefed on information pertinent to combating foreign interference in Canadian politics. He says he wants the information to be all be dumped publicly and says if he's instead made privy to classified information, there will be used against him because he won't be able to criticize the government as publicly. This comes off as suspicious because it just doesn't make any sense. It makes you wonder what his *real* reason for refusing to go through the process is. And that's not something I should even have to be thinking about.

Here's an unfortunately-plausible theory: Poilievre does have something to hide. Maybe it's people around him, people who work for him, somebody he makes deals with, who knows. But the idea is that he already aware of certain things it would benefit him to be able to pretend he has no knowledge of. If he receives security clearance and gets briefed on it, then he can pretend no longer. When it blows up in the future, he won't be able to plead ignorance, because he was briefed on it by CSIS. The information, and the record of it being presented to him, would force him to act now instead of later.

But really, who knows. This remains a troubling, albeit mysterious, aspect of Poilievre. And on his way out of the Prime Ministership, Justin Trudeau helped make a campaign ad [criticizing Poilievre for precisely this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvVDFdvaO3Y). I doubt Poilievre will budge on it, though, as he's been resisting this despite public pressure on him about it for a couple years now. If anything, the fact the Liberals so badly want him to do it may be causing him to dig his heels in.

# Other notes

* Poilievre said he would not only oppose but strictly ban any members of his cabinet from participating in the World Economic Forum. That seems fairly stupid, and kind of leaning into conspiracy theories about the WEF, which I dislike.
* He supports our legalization of marijuana, but opposes decriminalizing harder drugs. That's a reasonable stance.
* While some elements of the Conservative Party have been flirting with "anti-gender" sentiment from the US, Poilievre has mostly stayed away from it, except when reporters try and get him to talk about it. There was a moment where, in response to a question about whether trans women should be able to use female facilities, he essentially said no, and those should only be for females, not biological males. That's a little disappointing, and I think not aligned with the values of most Canadians---but even if this is something he personally feels, it's not something he's been vocal about at all, and policy about public washrooms is not in the purview of the federal government. For the most part, I doubt it's an issue.
* Earlier this year, when the Trump admin signed an executive order declaring there's only two genders, [Poilievre was asked what his feelings were about that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwfC9z4YWhs), and he said:
  <blockquote>*"Well, I don't know. Do you have any other genders that you'd like to name?* [...] *I'm not aware of any other genders than men and women, and I mean, if you have any other you want me to consider, you're welcome to tell me.* [...] *I'm only aware of two.* [...] *As far as I'm concerned, we should have a government that just minds its own damn business and just leaves people alone to make their own personal decisions. That's the kind of government I'm going to run."*</blockquote>
 This was a perfectly reasonable reply both in tone and content. It's also funny how unprepared the reporter was to answer Poilievre's question.
* Let's remember that Poilievre would get thrown out of the Republican Party if he were to go to the United States. The particular blend of positions he holds would only work in Canada. He's pro-abortion, he defends our healthcare system. He takes reasonable positions on many domestic policy issues. He's not an extremist or radical. I would not generally characterize him as far-right, despite being less moderate than some other Conservatives. He is, in most ways, in terms of his opinions, positions, or proposals, a good representation of, or a good voice for, the right wing of Canada.
* Poilievre's reaction to Trump threatening Canada's borders, economy, and sovereignty hasn't been perfect (I don't feel saying "Canada first" was the right note), but overall it hasn't been terrible either. He advocated for retaliatory tariffs, said he would encourage intra-Canadian trade, and strongly said Canada has no intention to ever be part of Canada. That's good---basically what's required of him, plus a bit more.

I suspect Poilievre embraced being the Conservative Party attack dog because he's a good speaker and quick on his feet---but in trying to take down Trudeau, he sacrificed too much of himself, he played too fast and loose with the facts, he got dirty with his rhetoric. If he truly believes he's the right choice for Canada and that he's just doing what it takes to win, then he may view this behaviour as justified. I don't.

If there were a sweeping Conservative victory, my hope would be that Poilievre's behaviour will change for the better. It's possible that as Prime Minister, he would be a new man from the one we know today as Opposition Leader. He could become more measured and unifying, more focused on governing than insulting, now that he's in the captain's chair instead of shadowing it.

However, I'm not betting on it. And acting poorly today isn't a good way to make me believe you're act better tomorrow. With all said and done, my view is that Poilievre is a demagogue, not very principled, that he's wrong for Canada. In effort to minimize the chances of the Conservative Party gaining control of the House, I'll be voting Liberal, and I hope that as many of my fellow Canadians as possible choose to do the same.

I'll do more to talk about problems with the Liberals and with our electoral system after the election. For now I just want to get through this.

<!--
The full Poilievre quote from that video:
    The radical woke agenda that Justin Trudeau instituted and that Mark Carney has said explicitly he wants to continue has divided our people. He's broken people into different ethnic, religious, cultural groups and turn them against each other. Liberals have deliberately divided community against community for electoral gain. And they have put in place an ideology that obsesses about every single possible ethnocultural division. And what is the result? A 251% increase in violent hate crime under this last decade of the Trudeau Carney Liberals. So I will end that radical woke ideology. I will treat every single Canadian equally. We will cut off the funds that have gone to antisemitic groups and to other hatemongers. We will pass tough new laws that punish people who vandalize or attack places of worship. We will deport foreign nationals who are in this country that engage in violence or lawbreaking of any kind, including antisemitic violence. And we will ban every single terrorist group that's operating here. We'll find and deport all of the IRGC thugs. There's apparently 700 IRGC who are in Canada today, operating with impunity, who are not citizens. They're spending the stolen money that they took from the Iranian people while they instigate divisions on our grounds in this country. They will be kicked out of this country. We're going to put our country first. And finally our approach is going to be that we are all Canadians. Every Canadian will be Canadian first. You can come from anywhere in the world, you can have any religious background you want. At the end of the day, we need a common identity with a common loyalty that puts that flag above everything else.
