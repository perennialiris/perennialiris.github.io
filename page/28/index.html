# The path of normalization

.2025-09-08

The example I remember was about bans on smoking in restaurants: surveys indicated the public was generally against such bans while the matter was being debated by lawmakers, but after the question was settled and new laws were passed, public sentiment shifted in favour of the bans instantly---before they even came into effect. It was an instance of numerous possible biases: a status quo bias, or a systemic justification bias, or, perhaps more aptly, what I'd describe as making peace with what you can't change.

When it was still only a proposal, people didn't like the sounds of restaurant policy changing. If it were up to them, they'd keep things the way they are. But once it became law, it felt like the deed was done, so resistance was pointless. Now that you can't stop it, you may as well get used to it. And once you start thinking that way, you realize the change doesn't even seem that bad. Maybe it's even good.

In 2016, when everybody expected Hillary Clinton to become US president, the institutional opposition to Donald Trump was high because he was viewed as a mistake, an aberration, an anomaly, a temporary glitch in the system. Just resist for a few years and things will return to normal, right? That's what we need: a return to normality. Or as Americans say, 'normalcy' (imaging me shuddering slightly). The political establishment---the Republican party, most of the media, the big companies, our tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, it felt like everybody was aligned against this man. (Psst: remember when Twitter was left-wing? Those were the days.)

It's been ten years now. Ten long years. Trump emerged as the frontrunner of the Republican Party, and he's been at the top of that pyramid ever since. He was president, during which he was enduringly popular with his supporters despite his ineptitude and shortcomings. Then he remained popular even while out of office, being the de facto voice of the party, the one person whom everybody on the right looked to and amplified. When the Republicans were choosing their 2024 candidate, Trump didn't even bother showing up to the debates, and all the conversation was still centred around him. He led in the polls, then easily won the nomination. Then he won the Presidency, this time by more than he did in 2016.

This is just how things are now. This is the Republican Party. That side of the country has been reöriented around him, destroyed and remade in his image.

This is where our status quo bias starts kicking in. It's where people start to make peace with the things they can't change, accepting the new things they can no longer prevent. And I don't mean to say this bias only started yesterday---it's more like we're really noticing the effects of it now, as it accumulates to critical mass. Trump's reëlection campaign was a fork in the road between a big sigh of relief, and all these biases that have been building up in people's heads finally cementing, hardening into an outer layer of defeated embrace.

All those things you said about Trump, years ago? They were true. He's everything you feared and worse. But those normal people, coming to watch your show? To buy your products? To use your website? The rank and file of our society, who aren't all in the trenches of political bickering? Half of them are fine with it. They're barely paying attention to what's going on, but they hear about how Trump is dismantling American democracy and rule of law, and they think "heh, whatever---at least he'll get rid of the immigrants or something." And if you spend every day telling them: "Trump is a fascist, he's a cancer metastasizing in your system"? They're not going to turn around and agree with you. They're just going to roll their eyes and feel alienated.

So you stop complaining. You stop talking about politics as much. You stop sounding the alarm. If you're a wealthy fucker, you donate to his campaign and show up at his events. May as well. This is just how things are now, I guess. Go with the flow. Don't want to get on his bad side, do you?

And now, even the people in the crowd who do agree with you? A lot of them don't want you to keep going on about it. They're exhausted. And they don't know what they can do about it at this point. They'd rather listen to something less depressing before they go back to work than read the details of the thousandth way Trump is upending the rule of law to centralize his own power while the Republican-led Congress plays with itself.

This is how I interpreted what happened with Bill Maher not too long ago. He went to the White House to have dinner with Trump for some reason. Then he went on his show the next evening and tried to tell us all that Trump is actually a gracious host, who's less crazy in private than when speaking to cameras. Was this really a surprising insight? That a guy seems more chill in private, in a setting where he's in control, after he won everything? Is this not something Maher and everybody else couldn't have just assumed? Moreover, why does it matter? Maher went from resisting to acclimating, from sounding the alarms to breaking bread. Why? Perhaps he's just telling himself that it's not so bad now that it's out of his hands, now that the election is over and there's nothing he can do but watch and complain.

Trump is a criminal like America has never known. He's leading the destruction of American values and institutions like nobody before him. He's leading an assault on the press, the courts, the universities, on states rights, on your constitutional rights. He's illegally disappearing people into some other country's prison system without trial. He's personally enriching himself and his company to the tune of billions while squeezing normal people out of the state benefits they paid into for decades. But I should care that he laughed at your jokes, and seems more composed when at a dinner table? This was so weird to listen to.

It's weird, but what makes me feel even more disgust than political media being complacent is when I see non-political media, the sort of outlet that normally covers celebrity gossip and the like, sharing slice-of-life news or updates or social media from the children and grandchildren of these disgusting people, like they're the new American royalty. Did you know that Elon Musk's kid is learning Arabic? Did you know Trump's granddaughter makes dresses in her spare time? And JD Vance has a---? No, no, I don't give a fuck. I could only care less in the sense that my revulsion probably has room to grow.

I don't even know if those two examples are real. They're probably not. I don't know. I made them up. I try to deliberately forget anything I accidentally learn about these people's extended families that's not political or business ties. They don't deserve that sort of trivial curiosity.

The normalization that we're seeing among many people as the reality of Trumpism sets in, the way they're slowly come to accept how things are as the temperature rises to a boil, is another one of those parallels with the Nazi rise to power---yes, *something something Godwin's law*, I don't care. The Nazis also called the media fake news while flooding the country with lies. They also had a nebulous cultural concept of wokeness they used to disparage anything they didn't like (their term was cultural Bolshevism, which they thought was infecting and degrading German art, music, and views on sexuality). They also hated gay and trans people and tried to purge academia to prevent people from reading books about those topics. The Nazis also acted like they were superior military men, despite mostly being dorks and crazies and drug addicts and failed creatives. They also had a controversial leader who tried to overthrow the government, failed, got in trouble, but then people were too lenient and forgiving, so then he came back and did it again without any lessons learned, and the second time succeeded.

And while the Nazis were organizing and trying to gain power, a big factor that drew normal people in wasn't a full-throated embrace of Nazi ideology, but a fear of all the things the Nazis warned about: the far-left, the Communists, the people who wanted to repeat in Germany the horrors of the revolution in Russia; and the Jews, the international finance-capital, the cultural Bolshevism destroying your culture, degrading your values, and setting up your economy in an unfair way that exploits good, hard-working Germans.

Germany ended up united around Paul von Hindenburg, the last president of Germany during the Weimar period, and the oldest politician ever. He was reëlected president in 1932, at age 85, after being well-known and respected in Germany for most of his life. He personally disliked Hitler and his government was distinctly against Nazism, but he was also too soft on them, trying to be a unifier, acknowledging that the Nazis had won a lot of seats in the Reichstag, and allowing Hitler to serve a position in government inferior to his own. Then he died in office, of lung cancer, at age 86, and Hitler took over the country. This parallel was all I could think of on that fateful day of June 27, 2024, the Biden--Trump debate, when it seemed like Joe Biden could barely speak and his mouth just hanged open while Trump was talking.

He was our Hindenburg. It was his destiny.

We could get off this train at any time. We don't need to keep echoing the last century until another Holocaust happens. But no matter how long it goes on, there's one part of the story that needs to be reached one way or another, and that's the Nuremberg Trials. There needs to be justice.

Trump is going to die soon. The day he does, I, for one, will celebrate, as I will again every year for the rest of my life. It will be a holiday, if an informal one. Join us for a drink as we commemorate the day America's very stable genius finally kicked the 18-piece bucket. It will likely happen before he ever faces justice for what he's done. There doesn't even seem to be any cosmic justice, in the form of shame and misery, which is what most people would experience if they were so detestable. The same cannot be said for those who've enabled Trump along the way. These people aren't even soldiers who were "just following orders"---they volunteered for these positions, hoping to gain something for theirselves in the process. The Republican members of Congress have the authority to stand up to Trump and even remove him from office if they so choose, but they prefer not to. They'd rather dance along.

The most obvious villains are Trump's long-time loyalists (Rudy Giuliani, Steven Miller, Roger Stone, Kellyanne Conway), as well as JD Vance and his tech-wizard sponsors (Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen). I don't necessarily condemn Trump's cabinet picks in 2016, but I do condemn anybody who stuck around since then, or joined on for the second term. Some of the current main characters are Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Pam Bondi, Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, RFK Jr., John Ratcliffe, Marco Rubio, Scott Bessent, Russell Vought, Mehmet Oz, Linda McMahon, Scott Turner, Sean Duffy, Brooke Rollins, Jamieson Greer, Kelly Loeffler, Susie Wiles, Peter Navarro, Steve Witkoff, and Howard Lutnick.

These are all people who should be if not in jail then ostracized by most of society. Either way, their choice to be part of this administration should be a reputation that follows them forever. Their children should be ashamed to identify them as their parents.
