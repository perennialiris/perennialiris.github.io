That's <span id="movie-count" class="digit"></span> movies.

I don't want to do a complex rating thing, but some of my favourites are:

-- Poor Things
-- Dial M for Murder
-- Twelve Angry Men
-- Edge of Tomorrow
-- Pride and Prejudice (the 2005 version starring Keira Knightley)

Some other commentary:

* **Star Trek: Section 31**. This was shockingly bad. *Star Trek* already didn't translate that well into movies anyway---the TNG movies had some good moments but were overall badly written---but this one somehow blew all previous attempts away. *Nothing* worked. They shouldn't have even released it.
* **Whiplash**. This movie is actually just dumb as hell. I sort of understand why people like it for the idea that it's *trying* to convey about becoming great under pressure or whatever, but the way it tried to convey that was just not good. The teacher was just an idiot, I'd have laughed in his face and been like dude what are you doing? I don't know how people took it seriously.
* **Elf**. Fuck this stupid, unfunny movie.
* **Zoolander**. Not the worst, but I had to accept Ben Stiller's sense of comedy just doesn't do it for me. Every silly movie he's in, I'm just... waiting for him to stop.

Why haven't I seen a single movie released in 2020 or 2021?
