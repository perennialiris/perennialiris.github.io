In 1206, the Delhi Sultanate was established by Muslim conquerors in northern India. This meant the territory ruled by the sultan from his seat in their capital of Delhi. The naming format is similar to 'the Roman Empire', meaning the territory ruled by the emperor from his seat in the city of Rome. This state grew and shank over the years until, while on the decline, the city of Delhi was conquered by **Babur** in 1526, which is considered the beginning of the Mughal Empire. The state Babur started would eventually consume nearly the whole Indian subcontinent, and for a time was the wealthiest power on Earth. The empire was referred to by its own people as **Hindustan**, or they spoke of 'the Sultanate' thereof; there was nothing officially called 'India', nor would there be for hundreds of years. They also never referred to theirselves as the Mughal Empire. The term 'Mughal' comes from the Persian for Mongol, as Babur was a descendant of Genghis Khan. At the time this would've been a respectful nod to their ancestry.
