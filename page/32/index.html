# Prejudice

.2025-10-30

What *is* prejudice?

The word looks like *pre-*, meaning *before*, and *judice* looks sort of like *judicial*, which reminds us of *judging*. That's the literal etymology, but pre-what? What are we judging *before*?

I believe the answer is: **prejudice is the general before the specific**. In that sense, prejudice is neutral. It can be right or wrong, the same way that your knowledge can be correct or mistaken, or your habits can be good or bad. Prejudice is a form of *social knowledge*.

I walk outside my house. I see a bear. How do I react? I can't know for sure if this bear is a threat to me, for it's *possible* it's a well-trained performance animal. And yet I know that bears are generally dangerous, ergo I react with caution. This is prejudice. I have a prejudice of bears, which is that I know them generally to be dangerous. And in this instance, I was well served by that prejudice.

A person without any prejudice, if you can imagine such a thing, would be utterly incapable of navigating the world -- a baby, essentially. They wouldn't know who their friends are, they wouldn't know what's a threat to them, they wouldn't be able to figure out any unfamiliar problem or interpret unfamiliar situations.

And the more knowledgeable a person becomes, the more discerning, the greater their ability to extrapolate and pass judgment and tell one thing from another.

*When does prejudice become a problem?*

A mistaken prejudice is one that is misaligned with reality. This can be a matter of exaggeration, a mistake of scale or amplitude, of misunderstanding the relation between facts, or of sheer dumb error.

For example, I once heard it said that gay men shouldn't be allowed to be schoolteachers, because most child molesters are gay men. I don't know if that is true and I suspect it isn't, but I replied by asking: but how many gay men are child molesters?

It could be that most such abuse is by gay men, but the vast majority of gay men don't do such abuse. Perhaps the difference you're describing amounts to 0.03% for the general population and 0.45% for gay men. That's 15 times higher, but still not even 1 in 200 people.

There are similar observations we can make about other group associations. Even if all terrorism were done by Muslims, it would still be that the vast majority of Muslims never engage in terrorism.

So sometimes your prejudice about a group is miscalibrated, and you may end up reacting to a person as though they present a danger of something which, in reality, they very likely do not.

### The triumph of the specific

If you have a perception about a general trend, but encounter an outlier -- something that doesn't fit your expectations -- then the specific ought to triumph. This is how a rational person behaves.

If you're in a city where there are many Chinese immigrants, and most of them have poor English, then you might, when speaking to a Chinese man you're meeting for the first time, speak more slowly and clearly, as one would with a person whose English skills are poor. But if he replies in perfect English, and you realize this is a man of Chinese background born and raised in your country who speaks English as well as any other person, you wouldn't carry on speaking slowly to him. You'd switch over and speak to him in the same way as you would anybody else. The specific triumphs over the general.

Where prejudice becomes vice is when you see instead an inversion of the general and specific -- that is, you treat the outlier as though it is the trend. We know this person is not merely the average impression of their group, and yet we continue to act as though they are. This often happens where a certain prejudice is held with contempt, or where the nonconformity of a person of a certain group to the average of that group causes us some sort of discomfort, especially if it's their excellence (i.e. literally excelling in some way) threatens a feeling of superiority that we've grown comfortable with.

For a more benign example of this, you could think about how you might feel if a young child came along and did better than you at something. Adults are accustomed to being better than children at pretty much everything, so feeling like you've been outdone by a young child can be embarrassing and make you feel stupid. But there are other forms of disruption that are less justified.

It's fair and accurate, for example, to expect that women know less about car mechanics than men do. That is going to be true most of the time. But even if a woman walks into your garage and says a few things that indicate she's highly knowledgeable of this area, there are men who would continue talking down to her about the topic, talking *as though* she doesn't know what she's talking about, or that she can't really know as much about this as it seems -- first, because they're so accustomed to feeling that women know less than them about this topic, and second, because the idea that a woman might know more about it than they do inflicts a certain discomfort. It makes them feel inferior by comparison.
 
A similar thing happens with race and ethnicity. If a person is used to thinking that most black people they encounter are uneducated and talking down to them, they might feel it's justified because it is true on average, but they might refuse to adjust their tone even if they meet a well-educated black man someday. They might still talk down to him, because they resent the idea of a black man being more educated than they expect, of a black man exceeding their prejudice.

Take Ilhan Omar, a woman from Somalia. There is a perception of Somalis as being people who fled to America from the chaos of Somalia -- many of them poor farmers with little education, many of them still holding onto what we consider more vulgar cultural values. And ergo, some people treat Omar *as though* she's a reflection of that average -- and they resent the fact she is, to the contrary, an intelligent, well-educated person who believes in American values to a degree greater than her vulgar critics.

They *want* to look down on her, and speak down to her, *as though* she is only what their prejudice anticipates. They *resent* that she has risen above their expectations, because her specific excellence in this respect threatens their general feelings of superiority. -- They don't *want* to look *up* to a *Somali*, because they *feel* that Somalis are *supposed to be* below them.

I believe that black Americans in general have been subject to a similar dynamic for a long time. The white experience was that, on average, black people are less wealthy, less educated, and more likely to engage in petty criminality, all of which causes white people to look down on them; but then a white person will persist in treating a black person as their lesser even if they encounter a wealthy, intelligent, law-abiding black person, who breaks from that pattern in their experience.

The feeling that you'll be treated as a lesser even if you personally excel is surely rather disheartening. This is the tyranny of the *general*.

It's a consequence not merely of prejudice, but of a race-based animosity, of a mindset or culture of superiority that is sensitive to challenge, and of the bias of judgment that comes from as irrational a place as hatred, or the playing out of a defense mechanism of one's ego.

### Transposing of qualities

If a man is lazy, then he is lazy.
If a black man is lazy, it goes to show that black people are lazy.

If a man is bad at math, then he's bad at math.
If a woman is bad at math, it goes to show that women are bad at math.

What's happening here?

We have a tendency to map negative observations about a person onto how we feel about any given identity of theirs that isn't dominant, the majority, or otherwise the presumed default. This means we make connections between things that may coincide in practice, but which may also deviate, and which have no necessary causal relation.

In the past, the rich looked down on the poor. They said the poor were dirty, uneducated, rude, they were thieves, they were lazy, and so on. Then poor *immigrants* came to the city, and those complaints were all repeated, but this time transposed onto *race*. It became, let's say, *the Mexicans* are dirty, uneducated, and so on -- seemingly, without it occurring to anyone how irrelevant *being Mexican* was to the rest. They're just describing the Mexicans the same way they used to describe the poor English.

Today often what is expressed as, or takes the form of, animosity toward a group, is rooted, really, in a grievance about something else. When somebody is being racist or otherwise hateful about something, it's worth asking what that *something else* is, so you might try talking about that instead.

I once knew a man who had a Persian landlord, and this landlord's behaviour sometimes upset him, to which he would react by cursing that Persian landlord. But what did his being Persian have to do with anything? Would the situation be improved in any way if he were of some other background? No? Then why are we bringing it up?

||image-float
xkcd-385.png|Issue 385 of the web comic xkcd, "How it Works", also illustrates what I'm describing here in a rather quick, minimalist way.

Once something becomes a stereotypical quality of a certain group, due to us making this type of connection repeatedly, we then become programmed to look for further examples of it. If we think that Asian people are bad drivers, we're more likely to notice when Asian people are bad at driving, and, any time they are, we take this as confirmation of the feelings we already had.

### Perception, conception

This is related to *the perception of out-group homogeneity*. The better we know a thing, the more we're able to perceive its internal diversity or difference -- and of course, we know ourselves better than we know others. Thus we see ourselves as more diverse, and others as more homogeneous. This is encapsulated neatly in the phrase, "they are alike; we are diverse".

Thus if a member of our group has a flaw, we understand this doesn't reflect on all of us. We are diverse -- some of us are flawed, but others less so. Whereas if a member of some other group has a flaw, we're more likely to see that as a reflection of the whole group -- because they are alike, or so we are more biased to *feel* they are alike. This one's flaw reflects on all of them.

This difference in perception seems to be a consequence of the difference in background data. When I conceptualize my own group, creating a model of us in my mind, I'm drawing from my experience of many thousands of people. If I then try to conceptualize some other group that I have less experience with -- Jewish people let's say -- that number is far smaller, a handful at most.

We may *understand*, when given the thought for consideration, that other groups of people must have internal diversity rivalling our own; but we haven't experienced it, so there's a pre-rational part of our mind that might not *feel* that diversity in the same way -- and so, if you aren't being thoughtful, or if you never stop and think about these things, your behaviour may default to that of somebody who believes "they are alike; we are diverse".

### Women

When we talk about prejudice, generalization, or stereotype, we're often referring to the social treatment of *out-groups*, which usually refers to a minority group. The main exception to this is women. Much of what is written about minority groups is also applicable to society's treatment of women, despite women, in many of our countries, outnumbering men. They *are not* a minority. So if *being a minority* isn't what causes the treatment in question, then what is?

A better descriptor of the sort of group we're talking about is *those who aren't the default*. If I say "a person walks into your place of business" but I provide no information about that person, a listener would assume this to be a white person. This is a function of white people being the majority. If you put the names of every person in our country into a hat and picked a name at random, the most likely result is to draw the name of a white person.

If I wanted you to think this person was Chinese, I would need to specify that.

This can be heard in how normal people talk, even where the distinctions are unimportant. I've heard people say things like: "I was at the library. There weren't many people in there. There was one person at the table reading, and a black dude using one of the printers. I heard the city is expanding the library budget this year."

Why did they tell us it was a black person? And what race do you suppose that makes the person who was at the table? If you don't stop and think about it, it doesn't even sound odd. If you're listening for it, you'll notice this type of thing in people's speech a lot. It's not necessarily harmful. It's just a reflection of what's happening in their mind. *We specify things that aren't the default.*

And women are not the default, despite often being the majority. If you say "a person walks into the building", it's presumed to be a man. And "he" is more often used when talking about an abstract or generic person, such as in "if any student disrupts the event, he will be docked marks".

This is a byproduct of men having more voice and agency than women historically. The vast majority of people who had any kind of political authority were men. Only men could be leaders within the church. Throughout society, men controlled nearly all money, had most of the power in their households, and were more likely to be the ones who wrote down important things.

### In other contexts

If we're talking about an area of society that is strongly associated with a certain group, the presumed default changes. If I said, "I was at yoga class earlier, and one of the other people there had a nice water bottle", you might have thought of a woman because that's what you associate with yoga class.

When the presumed default identity changes, you can see an inversion of the usual mapping of personal qualities onto the group identity. If a man is bad at math, he's bad at math. If a woman is bad at math, it goes to show that women are bad at math. But if a man is bad at vacuuming the house, or some other household chore, that may go to show men are bad at doing such things, and women may even suggest as much when they notice a man doing a bad job of it.

We could repeat this about other jobs or areas of society that are highly associated with a non-default type of person.
