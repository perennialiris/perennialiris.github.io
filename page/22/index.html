# Enduring falsehoods about Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton

.2024-12-19

It's generally more work to refute a false claim than to perpetuate it. And by the time somebody's got around to figuring out why a claim is false, the audience has already heard about it and moved on to the next thing, because people don't always bother verifying claims before passing them along. There's an old adage that says "a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on".

A related problem is how even after somebody investigates a false claim, the falsehood may linger in people's minds because the correction doesn't get as many views as the initial reporting. The result is that misinformation is often *sticky*, resistant to refutation.

When Kyle Rittenhouse was on trial, misinformation---claims of an unclear origin that had already been demonstrated to be false months earlier---was still being repeated on television, including by acting politicians. If you just watched the news, you may have heard people repeating that he illegally brought a gun across state lines, even though by that point it was known to be false. A surprising number of people had never seen the footage of the shooting, even a year after the event and with the trial ongoing, but still somehow managed to have strong opinions about it. I spoke with many people who thought Rittenhouse had killed three black people (every person he shot was white). What was going on?

Regardless of whether the US has good gun laws, or whether Rittenhouse was a well-intended person forced to defend himself or a reckless kid who was hoping somebody would give him an excuse to kill, there was something about that story that resulted in people having a difficult time keeping their facts straight.

### The Trump story

There's a story about Donald Trump that I considered misinformation from the day one, but which still lingers in the minds of people across the world years later: that he called a bunch of neo-Nazis 'very fine people'---or rather said there are 'very fine people on both sides' when one of the two sides in question were a bunch of neo-Nazis. That's obviously not the sort of thing you'd want the President to say, so of course people are upset, but this has always been a distortion of what was said that day, which was not unclear.

When Trump said "both sides" in that quote, the two sides he's referring to weren't "normal people and Nazis". He meant people who wanted to take down the statue of Robert E. Lee and the people who opposed taking it down. That's what the protest was originally about, and there *were* people defending the statue who weren't Nazis. But Nazis showed up in the town to capitalize on the event, and ended up taking over the evening, turning it into their own thing. Trump said there were very bad people in the pro-statue group, like white supremacists, but some of them were very fine people who just opposed taking down a representation of their state history.

Here's the relevant part of [the transcript from the Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/15/full-text-trump-comments-white-supremacists-alt-left-transcript-241662). And [the video footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGKbFA7HW-U) is easy to find online, if you want to listen to it instead.

**REPORTER:** *Do you think what you call the alt left is the same as neo-Nazis?*
**TRUMP:** Those people -- all of those people, excuse me -- I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups, but **not all of those people were neo-Nazis**, believe me. **Not all of those people were white supremacists** by any stretch. ... **Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue [of] Robert E. Lee.** ... This week, it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? ...
*... [reporters then ask about other topics, before one brings it up again] ...*
**REPORTER:** *The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville.*
**TRUMP:** Excuse me, they didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you **also had people that were very fine people on both sides**. You had people in that group---.... I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
**REPORTER:** *George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.*
**TRUMP:** George Washington was a slave owner. ... So will George Washington now lose his status? ... How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay, good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? It's fine, you're changing history, you're changing culture, and you had people -- and **I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally -- but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists**, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
**REPORTER:** *I just didn't understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?*
**TRUMP:** No, no.

If you look at any big news reporting of the day *before* that march at night with the tiki torches, it does seem like there was a big crowd of normal people standing around. Can we say those guys were fine people? I don't know anything about them, so maybe they're not exactly good people, but the least we can say is they aren't Nazis.

Call it a broken clock, but Trump was right about people coming after statues of George Washington, and various other historical figures for that matter, many of them not clearly 'bad guys' like many of us view the American Confederates. That's just where it started. We were going through some kind of 'historical figure purity mania'. It seems to be over by now, but that was the atmosphere at the time.

The only way I can see somebody thinking Trump called Nazis fine people is if they just read that one sentence out of context. They read a Nazi rally happened, and they see a headline: *"Trump on Charlottesville: 'Very fine people' on both sides"*. Then they don't bother looking into it at all.

**But do you realize what's happening here?** What am I doing? Why are we wasting our time trying to grant Trump some level of charitability? Even if you subtract all of this from the public record, it's not like you're going to do a 180 and decide you like Trump now. It's like having an argument about whether or not Hitler beat his wife. The fact he *didn't* call Nazis fine people doesn't matter when it's in the shadow of all the other terrible things Trump has said. So I have little practical reason to care.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGKbFA7HW-U)

Nor does it even vindicate his response to this one event. Think about it: a literal neo-Nazi rally just happened in modern America. Why would your main concern be pointing out that some of the people who were on the same side as the Nazis on some local political issue aren't so bad? This is obviously a failure of your duty to condemn hatred and extremism. Look at how other Republicans responded:

||indent
**Ted Cruz**: "The Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists who gathered there --- they're racists, they're bigots, they're idiots, and they're spreading lies."[](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/sen-ted-cruz-blasts-white-nationalists-charlottesville-idiots-n793366)
**Bush Jr & Bush Sr**: "America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms."[](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/charlottesville-george-bush-statement-trump-racial-bigotry-republican-presidents-condemn-a7897391.html)
**Paul Ryan**: "We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity."[](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/346701-ryan-white-supremacy-is-repulsive/)

Imagine a mirrored scenario. It's 2022 and there's a conflict in some American city. Let's say a city government plans on taking down something public that left-leaning people favour. To match the controversy aspect, let's say it's a statue of somebody with a complicated past, like Harvey Milk or Huey P. Newton. A left-wing protest is planned, right-wing counter-protesters show up, and then a bunch of communists and antifa show up and win the day, culminating in a big ol' communist march where people with torches go around chanting death to America, we hate Christianity, we're coming for your children (unfortunately, [left-wing activists have literally chanted that before](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/nbc-out-proud/re-coming-children-chant-nyc-drag-march-elicits-outrage-activists-say-rcna91341)). The next day, videos of masked figures with pictures of Mao Tse-tung and signs with slogans like "liberals get the bullet too" circulate on the news and flood social media. How do you think Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, Chuck Schumer, and any other major Democratic Party figure you can think of, would respond the next day? Where would their focus be? What kind of language would they use?

It feels insane to 'defend' Donald Trump by pointing out his bad, stupid, irresponsible response wasn't quite *as bad* as people think. There are better people worth defending.

Let's explore an example.

## Elizabeth Warren didn't pretend to be an American Indian

If a person has done 100 things wrong, and you learn 1 of those things was misreported, your overall opinion of them is likely not significantly changed, because they've still done 99 things wrong. This is going to be the case with a figure like Donald Trump who's done a great many things to upset people and impugn his own character---but sometimes just one or two lies can dominate the reputation of an otherwise reputable person, meaning if they were to be refuted, your opinion about them *could* significantly change.

Such is the case with **Elizabeth Warren**. She's been a US Senator from Massachusetts since 2013 and gained significant publicity from her 2020 bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. In terms of her political positions, she's somebody many Americans will find disagreeable, but in terms of her conduct and character has always been a respectable and honest actor. Despite this, there are many people whose knowledge and impression of her consists mostly of the following story:

* she claimed to be a Native American,
* Trump called her out on it publicly,
* she took a DNA test that confirmed she was lying, and was only like 0.1 percent Native or something,
* and then had to issue an apology to the actual Native Americans.

Oh, how embarrassing! But every aspect of this story is wrong, and unfortunately it takes much longer to explain why than to repeat and forward the lies. Warren herself, probably on advice from people on her team, just tries to move on and not talk about this whole controversy, probably because it's too much effort to refute and most people aren't going to listen.

The story starts in 2012, during her first Senate race. The person she was against speculated that she pretended to have Native ancestry to get an advantage professionally (before getting into politics, Warren taught law at several US universities). Though baseless, the claim was investigated, and her old employers were contacted, old documents requested.

It was reported that Warren [did write 'American Indian' on a form at some point decades earlier](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/16/17983250/elizabeth-warren-bar-application-american-indian-dna), but it didn't seem to confer any advantage in her schooling or work---it was just an optional write-in for data collection. *The Boston Globe* also investigated the matter and reported that in 'documents and interviews' there was not only no evidence of anybody thinking of Warren as a Native American, but clear counter-evidence, indicating [Warren was always viewed and considered a white woman by those who hired her.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/09/01/did-claiming-native-american-heritage-actually-help-elizabeth-warren-get-ahead-but-complicated/wUZZcrKKEOUv5Spnb7IO0K/story.html)

I can't find the original text, but apparently Warren also contributed to a 'local cookbook' in 1984 called *Pow Wow Chow*, which was meant to feature Indigenous themed recipes, and she's billed as *Elizabeth Warren, Cherokee*.[](https://www.bostonherald.com/2012/05/17/pow-wow-factor-elizabeth-warren-touted-native-roots-in-84-cookbook/) Did she just say her family had Cherokee ancestry, so she figured some old family recipes could basically be considered Cherokee recipes? Supposedly she contributed recipes for sugar cake and peach cobbler, and the book was made by a cousin of hers back in Oklahoma, where Warren was born. Publications like *The Daily Mail* [ran articles about this cookbook, claiming Warren's recipes weren't *proper* Cherokee dishes](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2146628/Elizabeth-Warrens-Pow-Wow-Chow-Cherokee-recipes-word-word-COPIES-famous-FRENCH-chefs-techniques.html), or weren't *really* generational family recipes, and she probably just copied them from a newspaper! And hey, maybe she did. Maybe she thought it was just a cookbook and didn't think anyone would really care or look into it. Maybe they're wrong and these were all recipes that her grandmother taught her, so she figured they counted as Cherokee recipes. There's barely any info to go off, so I don't know, and I don't think I care.

Wouldn't it be nice if people paid this much attention to every random thing a Republican politician lied about? Why was so much poured into this, of all things? It wasn't even something Warren brought up on the campaign trail. It's not like she got on stage and said "elect me and I'll be the first Native American senator" or something like that. It was never part of her public persona. Nobody knew or cared about it until her opponent brought it up, and it's somehow been a defining part of Warren's public image ever since. It's one of the worst cases I know of an undeservedly bad reputation.

Trump got wind of it and started adding to the dishonest telling of events, because of course. Warren pretends to be a Native American, he says, but she's not really, so let's all sarcastically call her 'Pocahontas'. Trump then brought up the notion of her getting a DNA test, claiming that [he would pay a million dollars to a charity of her choice if she got a test result that says she's Indian](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-challenges-pocahontas-warren-dna-test-prove-she-s-native-n889206). And to everyone's surprise, [Warren did just that,](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/15/elizabeth-warren-dna-test-indian-899927) and asked Trump to give the money to the *American Indigenous Women's Resource Center*. He didn't.

Let's take a step back, though.

### What did Warren actually claim about herself?

For one, it wasn't that she's genetically Native. Nor did she claim to have tribal citizenship, or call herself a member of an Indian tribe, or even say she *knew* somebody who was a tribal member. The only thing she ever really said was she remembers, while growing up, she and her brothers being told their family had Native ancestry, and this connection was 'part of [their] story' as a result.

What does that mean? For some people it's obvious, but for others maybe not.

We all have four grandparents, but it's normal for our grandparents to have very different levels of influence on our lives. Plenty of people only really know two of their grandparents, sometimes only one. I have a friend who's half-Japanese, on his father's side. His father's mum died when he was young, and his mother's parents weren't around as much. So he's genetically only a quarter Japanese, but *being Japanese* is a big part of how he views himself, because he grew up in a household with an internal culture largely influenced by Japanese media, he grew up speaking the language, and he had the regular presence of his Japanese grandfather. It could get even more disconnected if we suppose that grandfather wasn't even fully Japanese himself, despite being from Japan.

Would this person be lying if he said he's Japanese? What if he just said that he has Japanese heritage? The point is when you're talking about identity, culture, upbringing, and narrative, things are hazier than being either this or that. It's entirely plausible, in this understanding, that Warren had some older relative, let's say a great-grandfather, who considered himself a Native American, and for that person to have had a significant influence on the family at some point. That might not appear significantly on a DNA test, but could still influence the family's view of itself and their story. Which is more in line with how Warren has always talked about it.

"I knew it was part of our family. ... It was part of what we talked about. ... It was just part of who we were."
--- Elizabeth Warren, speaking in 2012

Reporters called Warren's extended family back in 2012 to ask about their memory of this matter. Her second cousin (i.e. their grandparents were siblings), Ina Mapes, 77, said it was her father who had Native American roots, and that his father agreed he was *one-quarter tribal blood*, as they put it. Meanwhile, all of Elizabeth Warren's siblings came forward issuing a statement in her defense, saying "we grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives talk about our family's Cherokee and Delaware heritage" (*Delaware* here refers to the Delaware Tribe in Oklahoma, not the US state of Delaware).

Oklahoma is one of the US states with [the highest percentage of people who claim to have Native Indian ancestry](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/10/2020-census-dhc-a-aian-population.html), and experts think the number could be far higher than reported due to widespread intermixing (somebody who's half-Indian genetically is still 'a person with Indian ancestry', so the more intermixing that happened, the more people can say that about theirselves) and historical racism against Indians that caused some Indians who had light enough skin they could pass as white, or just convince a US census-taker they were, to do so and to go on. This could cause disagreement as to whether somebody was really an Indian or not, because people would try and hide it. Later on, when kids are trying to figure out if their father was part-Indian or if he wasn't, it can be a tricky. They might know a person who claims he was and one who claims he wasn't.

The geneticist who did the test confirmed Warren was mostly of European DNA, but [with signs of an 'unadmixed' (i.e. not part-European) Indian ancestor 6 to 10 generations ago](https://theconversation.com/two-native-american-geneticists-interpret-elizabeth-warrens-dna-test-105274). That sounds like a wide range, because it is---these tests are generally imprecise and suck. There was also some question about the validity of this test because the database used [mostly Natives from Central and South America](https://theconversation.com/two-native-american-geneticists-interpret-elizabeth-warrens-dna-test-105274), with a lack of samples from American tribes. Not interested in getting into this level of detail, most people just saw that '6 to 10 generations ago' statement and ran with it, claiming her test results confirmed she was 1/64 to 1/1024 Indian. That's 1.56% to 0.1%, an amount so trivial that claiming to be Native American would be taken as tantamount to a falsehood---which is how a lot of people thought the story ended.

The problem with this whole conversation is **tribal identity isn't genetic.** That's what Warren *actually* apologized for---not claiming to be Native, but talking about Native identity *as though* it's a genetic phenomenon and as though 'being Indian' was a question of your DNA in the first place. Chuck Hoskin Jr, then-secretary of the Cherokee Nation, made public statements indicating his displeasure not with her claiming to be Indian but with how the topic was being framed. In the mainstream of white America, being 'Native American' is often talked about like a race, like being black, but that's not how they view it, and that's not how they want us to view it either.

Imagine it's the 17th century and a member of an Indian tribe has children with a European. In the Indians' view, those children aren't 'half-members'. They're just members. They grow up among them, they identify as one of them, they *are* one of them. It was even possible for people with no genetic connection to any Indian tribe to become members. By comparison, would you use a DNA test to determine whether somebody is an American citizen? No, because it fundamentally *couldn't* determine that. And to even take a DNA test for that reason implies something wrong about what it means to be an American and could cause offense.

Elizabeth Warren understands this. And she realized the act of releasing a DNA test---albeit one that people more ignorant on the topic had demanded---helped cause further confusion about the concept of tribal citizenship. That's why she apologized, and tried to clarify to the press that she's not a member of any tribe---something she never claimed, but realized people were mistaking her claim to have been. That apology played all over the internet, where people misinterpreted it as being her admitting she was factually wrong to ever claim she had Native ancestry. Warren apologized because she has a conscience and cares about this issue. And she is still, on the whole, viewed positively by the American Indian community. After this whole ordeal, Deb Haaland, the first American Indian elected to the US Congress, [called Warren a great partner for Indian Country, endorsing her for President](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/native-american-congresswoman-endorses-elizabeth-warren-debra-haaland/).

Let's state this, in conclusion: **Elizabeth Warren didn't claim to have Native ancestry to advance her career in law or politics.** Nor did she lie about having Native ancestry---except maybe exaggerating it for a cookbook back in 1984, that she probably didn't think any of us would ever read. **The public statements she made about her ancestry since getting into politics** have all turned out to be true. And **the DNA test she took didn't disprove her story**. It **confirmed** it.

Taking a step back, realize that Warren's opponents had to focus on this bullshit smear because they had nothing else on her. She had no other obvious weaknesses or controversies, beyond actual policy disagreements, and god forbid anyone talk about policy in politics. That won't work. What other criticism of her can you recall anybody making, ever? They found this one thing and latched onto it as hard as they could, repeating it until it dominated the conversation. The right-wing media played into it, and then the Republican president played into it. She couldn't get away.

But Warren isn't the woman in American politics who's been most unfairly defamed over the years. That title has to go to one Hillary Clinton, first lady of the US in 1993--2001, Senator from New York in 2001--2009, secretary of state for the Obama administration in 2009--2013, and the Democratic Party's nominee for the 2016 presidential election.

## Hillary Clinton and her damn emails

The story, as many people now remember it, is that some number of years ago Hillary Clinton was subpoenaed for some reason---something about how she was handling classified information, maybe?---and then she responded by deleting all of her emails off her private email server, which she wasn't even supposed to have anyway. The nerve! And who knows how many crimes she hid by doing so.

I can't think of any other story that has been so overblown politically. The Republican Party brought this up as often as they could. In the Trump Cinematic Universe, "but what about Hillary's email server?" became a magical sentiment, and carte blanche for them to engage in any corruption and criminality they wanted. Because who cares? Hillary did it.

The most powerful force in politics in recent decades is disillusionment. Not convincing us the bad guys are great, but convincing us the good guys *aren't* so great. If everyone's bad, if we all do crime and we all sin and we're all terrible, then what's the difference? Why lift a finger to fight evil if *everyone* is evil? This is the effect that's helped normalize the latest incarnation of the Republican Party, and Hillary Clinton was a centrepiece of that strategy. The same tactic motivates people to argue that Churchill was actually the villain of World War II.

**What's true?** Clinton and her team used a private email server, which means an email server that wasn't the official state department email. Then Clinton and her team mishandled classified documents via email. Is that a problem? Yes, of course---but it's also a *broad* problem, not only with Clinton but with seemingly all top-level American executives. That's why the Trump administration had similar issues,[](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/21/their-emails-seven-members-trumps-team-have-used-unofficial-communications-tools/)[](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/politics/private-email-trump-kushner-bannon.html)[](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/cummings-jared-kushner-and-ivanka-trumps-private-emails-texts-raise-security-concerns) and now we're seeing them again in [the second Trump administration](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/18/federal-officials-nervous-about-sending-data-to-trump-transition-private-emails-00195217). Even the FBI director that investigated Clinton [has made similar mistakes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/06/14/hillary-clinton-justice-report-fbi/703886002/). The reality is these older people in government all prefer to use their own devices and not bother thinking about security, which is why the FBI has to go around trying to make them follow the rules. It only became a huge story worthy of a national spotlight when Clinton was the one being targeted.

In 2016, the FBI director stated there was no evidence to suggest Clinton had deliberately done anything wrong, and that no reasonable prosecutor would bring criminal charges against her if she coöperated. That's usually how cases like this played out. It's resistance to enforcement of these rules that gets you into serious trouble, not making a mistake but then allowing it to be corrected when somebody contacts your office about it. (In 2022, when the FBI launched an investigation into Trump for his mishandling of classified info after his presidency, the issue there was he actively disobeyed and fought with the FBI, tried to hide the documents he knew he had, instructed his lawyers to lie to investigators, and other malicious actions that are very much the opposite of coöperation. Nothing like this happened in Clinton's case---nor in Joe Biden's similar classified documents case the following year.)

In February, Clinton publicly argued she didn't send anything that was classified, but admitted things may have been classified retroactively. Let's think: if I send you a document and then it's declared classified the next day, who's coming to your house and marking that as classified on your email server, or deleting it from your server if you no longer have a right to view it? I don't know how that's handled. Is classified stuff just never supposed to be emailed? But what about things that are made classified after it's been emailed already?

In July, after the FBI had looked into this more, they revealed Clinton's defense was partially true: thousands of emails containing classified info were classified *after* they were sent. But hundreds more contained info that was classified at time of sending, some of it explicitly labelled as such and some not. It's possible Clinton or members of her team didn't *realize* things they were sending were classified, and that the marking system being used was unclear. That's when the FBI director said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that no reasonable prosecutor would charge Clinton with anything.

But that wasn't the end of it, because then once again, in late October 2016, the FBI notified Congress it had found *more* emails and was reöpening their investigation, looking into the matter once more. This turned up nothing---but the *announcement*, less than two weeks before an election, couldn't have been less talked about. This controversy about Hillary Clinton's email server [received more media coverage than any other topic or issue throughout the whole year-long election season](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-national-conventions/). As a reminder, the man she was running against was on record saying climate change was [a hoax invented by China](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/world/asia/china-trump-climate-change.html).

### What about her deleting all her emails once they were subpoenaed?

That part was always a lie. There was no evidence for it, they knew there was no evidence for it, but they asserted it anyway, repeatedly, and millions believe it.

It's normal procedure for large organizations to delete emails every so often, and to destroy electronic devices every so often. It's the same way organizations don't hold onto paperwork forever. If the police try to find your emails and it turns out they'd been deleted, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. There would need to be evidence the emails were deleted *after the fact*, in response to the subpoena, to avoid being found. Then you might have something. And that's not at all what happened here.

For their email, Clinton and her team used servers provided by some networking company. They had been configured to automatically delete emails every so often. In 2014, somebody who worked for Clinton requested to shorten the retention period to a few months to clear out personal emails they no longer needed. The technician at the company, for some reason, didn't bother. Perhaps he forgot. The following year, a House committee issued a subpoena, somebody who worked for Clinton contacted that company, and the employee realized he hadn't made that change like they requested months ago, so [he instantly deleted all the emails that were supposed to have been deleted the year before](https://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/the-fbi-files-on-clintons-emails/).

Despite many other emails being recovered, and despite Clinton herself having no connection to the deletion, her Republican opponent got on stage and claimed Clinton deleted all her emails after a subpoena to hide evidence, and right-wing voices across the country echoed the claim ad nauseam. By late October, when the FBI director said he was reöpening the investigation, the public was primed to interpret that as confirmation of everything the Republicans had been alleging.

It was openly suggested the mere fact Clinton was under investigation *at all* was a strong reason to not elect her president. How quaint that seems now in hindsight, no?

Hillary Clinton at worst accidentally mishandled some classified documents. And she isn't supposed to be using a private email server at all, according to rules about that sort of thing for government officials, and she probably knew better. This is one of those things that 'everybody' does wrong, though---not that it excuses her, but it makes focusing on her in particular unjustified. And then everything *else* you've heard about the email server scandal has been misinformation.

### Wait, what about Benghazi?

Why was Hillary Clinton even being subpoenaed to begin with? It has something to do with Benghazi, a city in Libya. The US had facilities there, and in 2012 an Islamic militant groups attacked on September 11 (yes, deliberately, because of 9/11). This led to four Americans dying, including the US Ambassador to Libya. There were various Congressional committees that investigated the matter, and none were able to produce anything substantive to charge either Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton with any kind of improper behaviour. Obama and Clinton both also acted properly while being investigated, including Clinton giving testimony before a committee under oath three separate times---the third one lasted for 11 hours. After the hearing, the Republican in charge of it told the press they hadn't uncovered anything noteworthy.[](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/28/in-final-report-benghazi-committee-finds-no-new-evidence-of-clinton-wrongdoing/)[](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-benghazi.html) An enormous amount of time and energy was poured into trying to get her on something, *anything*---and it all failed.

Whose fault was the attack, really? I don't know. But neither do the people who wanted you to think it was all Hillary Clinton's fault. That was all for show.

Hillary became a lightning rod for right-wing dissatisfaction with 'the establishment'. The angle of attack was that she had been in politics for so long---being the wife of a US president, then being a senator, then working as secretary of state, always so close to power---that she must be corrupt, and is therefore to blame for the present state of the country. They held hearings about Benghazi over and over because they wanted to create the illusion that she must've done *something* wrong pertaining to Benghazi, despite all their investigations and hearings amounting to nothing.

Today, baseless conspiracy theories have become open and accepted on the right. Back in 2016, it was only the beginning, and much of it began around Hillary Clinton. In addition to all the lies about her email server and the irresponsibility of the media and the FBI to not mislead the public about that story, another major point that affected her campaign was an organization called 'WikiLeaks' facilitating Russian hackers targeting John Podesta[](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/russia-us-election/)[](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/russia-responsible-podesta-wikileaks-hack-230095), Clinton's campaign chairman, and releasing his emails to the public. It was later revealed the Trump campaign was in direct contact with both WikiLeaks[](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/13/donald-trump-jr-communicated-with-wikileaks-during-final-stages-of-election)[](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-secret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/) and [with Russian operatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting).

This led to conspiracy theories online about Democratic Party leaders engaging in satantic rituals and pedophilia---theories which WikiLeaks itself helped promote---including the infamous ['pizzagate' conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory), in which it was alleged that 'pizza' was being used as a coded message in these emails to hide a human trafficking and child sex ring in plain site. This led some believers in the theory to [attack random pizzerias in Washington D.C.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/business/media/comet-ping-pong-pizza-shooting-fake-news-consequences.html)

During this time, people on the internet were calling her 'Killary' and fantasizing about her assassinating all her political opponents, or people who were involved in these leaks, or people at WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks even tried to push a fabricated quote of Hillary advocating to kill Julian Assange (the company's founder and director) in a drone strike.

## Marie Antoinette

Finally, while we're on the topic of women who an undeservedly negative reputation (well, I only mentioned two people and they were both coincidentally women, but three's a crowd), let's give an honourable mention to **Marie Antoinette** (1755--1793), who is now most remembered as the speaker of a fabricated quote: when told the poor could not afford bread, it's said she replied, "then let them eat cake" (the idea being that when *she* was out of bread, she simply ate something else instead---why don't they?).

An Austrian princess, Marie Antoinette was born 'Maria Antonia', but chose to use the French version of her name after being married off at age 14 to Louis Auguste, who was not yet King of France, but heir apparent under the reigning Louis XV---his grandfather. His father died at an early age, before ascending to the throne. Their grandfather died four years later, and Marie Antoinette was suddenly Queen of France. The fact she was from Austria was used against her throughout her life, as the two countries were during this period not on the best of terms.

The revolutionaries wanted to stoke anger in France to incite the public to revolt. For them, Marie Antoniette became a symbol of everything they believed was wrong with France. In addition to making up this quote, intended to portray her as so clueless and privileged as to be completely out of touch with the reality faced by most common people, they also claimed she had illegitimate children, told stories about her stealing from the palace, and blamed the country's financial difficulties on her lavish personal spending (for, like other French noblewomen, she had rather nice things).

The "let them eat cake" attribution doesn't even make sense, for we know rather well that Marie was not ignorant of the conditions of the poor, nor the relative value of bread and cake. It was a cartoonish exaggeration.

Though she wasn't without any political agency, and did take action designed to help preserve the monarchy---as one should expect of a noblewoman who has known no life but the one she was given---Marie Antoinette was an essentially innocent woman, a victim of circumstance, a scapegoat. She died at age 37, executed in public by decapitation after being accused of all sorts of things. Her last recorded words are said to have been "Pardon me, sir; I did not do it on purpose", after stepping on her executioner's shoe---something far more in character for a woman who was as much a paragon of high society as she.
