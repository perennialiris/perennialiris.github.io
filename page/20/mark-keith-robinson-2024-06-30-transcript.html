The young men and women that I’ve met personally that served in Iraq and Afghanistan, who have lost limbs, been burned, lost their minds, lost their families, lost their standing in their community, are living on the streets---while those who have walked across our border live in luxury hotels. That’s the cost of your freedom. That’s the cost of my freedom. That’s why as Americans, we need to continue to be just as bold as those men were on July 4, 1776.
 
We don’t need to ask Joe Biden for anything. We don’t need to ask the federal government for anything. Everything that was given to us was given to us on July 4, 1776, and was given to us when Jesus Christ died on the cross, suffering in pain for your freedom, for my freedom. The same boldness, the same strength, that drove those men, drove those women, to fight for this nation and give their lives for this nation should be the same boldness and strength we display every single solitary day.
 
I told those people at that meeting we were at about the press: you think I’m scared of you? You think I’m supposed to be scared of you? Let me tell you something: I come from some people that weren’t scared of those redcoats. I come from some people that weren’t scared at the Little Round Top when the Confederates were coming up. They weren’t scared of the Japanese, the Nazis, or none of the rest of them. They weren’t scared at Khe Sanh, they weren’t scared at Pork Chop Hill, they weren’t scared on 9/11. They weren’t scared in Iraq or Afghanistan. I don’t come from a stock of people who are weak and ineffective and miserable and who have to beg for things and ask politely. That’s not what we do in America. That’s not what we should do in America.
 
We should never take a step back from our freedom, folks. When it is challenged, when our freedom is challenged, we should step up in boldness. It doesn’t matter how old you are, how young you are, whether you’re a student, whether you’re a worker, it doesn’t matter who you are in this nation---that constitution was crafted for you. And more importantly, Jesus Christ died for you, to give you your freedom. You should protect your freedom at all costs, folks.
 
You see, there’s a class of people in this nation that want you to forget that. They want control. They want control. They don’t care about Democrat, they don’t care about Republican, they don’t care about anything, they care about control. They want control, and the trappings that come with it. That’s why they despise America.
 
You see, being the king is all about being in control. When those men in 1776, when they sent that letter to King George, when they sent it to him, King George knew he had lost control, and he knew he would never get it back, no matter what he did. You know, I can almost see him now, reading that letter. I bet he was steaming hot, just like on a little cartoon they used to show, he probably threw it down and started jumping on top of it. Put his redcoats in boats and sent ’em on over and said “go take care of them guys for me”. But see, there was a little problem here: King George was used to fighting wars over possessions. King George was used to fighting over land, and King George was used to fighting people who were fighting for the concept of what we call plunder. King George’s men weren’t ready to fight people who were ready to fight for a concept, for a belief, for an idea unseen, for a nation unseen. He wasn’t ready for that.
 
And you know, in a lot of ways, that’s what’s wrong with our country right now. We’ve become so highfalutin and educated, and we’ve got Google, we got Google so we don’t need god no more. So we’ve forgotten our founding ideals. Forgotten who we are. Forgotten the concepts that we’re fighting for. And because we have, we now find ourselves struggling with people who have evil intent. You know, there was a time when we used to meet evil on the battlefield, and guess what we did to it? We killed it. We didn’t quibble about it, we didn’t argue about it, we didn’t fight about it. We killed it. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour, what did we do? We flew to Japan, and we killed the Japanese army and navy. We didn’t even quibble about it. I didn’t start this fight, you did! You wanted to be left alone? You should have left me alone. We didn’t argue and capitulate and talk about “well maybe we shouldn’t fight the Nazis that hard”. No, they’re bad---kill them. Some liberal somewhere is going to say that sounds awful. Too bad.
 
Get mad at me if you want to: some folks need killing. It’s time for somebody to say it. It’s not a matter of vengeance. It’s not a matter of being mean or spiteful. It’s a matter of necessity. We have people doing wicked things---torturing and murdering and raping. It’s time to call out those guys in green, and go have ’em handle it, or those boys in blue, and have ’em go handle it. We need to start handling our business again, because guys, what I said at the beginning about you getting in your cars, and listening to your radio, putting on what you want to put on, and saying what you want to put on. Keep thinking about it. Don’t you feel it slipping away? Don’t you feel it slipping away?
 
The further away we get from the concept of 1776 and why we declared our independence and how we declared our independence, the further we start sliding into making 1776 a distant memory, and the tenets of socialism and communism start coming into clearer focus. They’re watching us. They’re listening to us. They’re tracking us. They get mad at you. They cancel you. They dox you. They kick you off social media. They come in and close down your business. Folks, it’s happening. And the reason why---I will submit to you the reason why it’s happening to us---is because we have forgot who we are, where we came from, and who paid the price to get us to where we are. We were bought with a price, and so was this nation, and that price was blood. The very first blood was the blood of Jesus Christ, which was to wash our sins away, to make us holy. And to give us the wisdom to be able to operate. And all the blood that has followed since has been the blood of men and women who loved this nation, who were willing to lay down their lives for us. They didn’t know us, couldn’t see us, but they knew of us, and they knew what we could become. And now it is time for us to show them what we will do for their sacrifice, and what we will do with their freedom. Will you lay down and let it be washed away? Or will you stand up and make sure it is preserved?
