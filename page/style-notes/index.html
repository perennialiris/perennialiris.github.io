.Notes for my own writing

#### American--British spelling differences:

I grew up with British spellings, but today I use a combination of British and American spellings depending on which one I think feels better or makes more sense to me.

Reference for common differences (American left, British right, my preference bold):

||table this .col-odd { border-right: 1px solid var(--grey-a); text-align: right; padding-left: 30px; }
labor | **labour** | canceled | **cancelled**
center | **centre** | **organize** | organise
**estrogen** | oestrogen | check | **cheque**
**program** | programme | **jail** | gaol
dialog | **dialogue** | **license** | licence
jewelry | **jewellery** | fulfills | **fulfils**
ton | **tonne** | **aluminium** | aluminum
artefact | **artifact** | **paralyze** | paralyse

#### Quotation marks

Don't include the final punctuation mark inside quotation marks unless it's a question mark or exclamation point that's part of what's being quoted.

For example: my friend asked me why I like root beer, and I said "because it tastes good". She said "do you like cats?", and I said "sure", even though I'm not crazy about them.

#### Don't capitalize black and white (in reference to race)

Traditionally neither word was capitalized because they're just descriptors, like blonde, or tall, or funny. There's no proper noun you're associating yourself with. That remains my position today.

Then, as I recall, people randomly started capitalizing it in 2020 (and declaring their intent to do so: [1](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/time-to-capitalize-blackand-white/613159/) | [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/insider/capitalized-black.html) | [3](https://apnews.com/article/71386b46dbff8190e71493a763e8f45a)) when protests in the United States were ongoing following the murder of George Floyd, right around the time everybody on social media was [changing their profile pictures to black squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_Tuesday). It was a funny consolation prize: "Hey buddy, it looks like the police are mistreating you. How about we capitalize your word for some reason?"

What's really funny is, do we capitalize white too? You'd think so, but a lot of people don't, and some [serious sources](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/capital-b-black-styleguide.php) even tried to argue there's a valid reason for the distinction. Not for you, white man! It feels like something a right-wing comedy writer would've made up ten years before it happened.

#### Theirselves, theirself, hisself

Years ago, I made a deliberate choice to stop using the words "themself", "themselves", or "himself". Instead I use "theirself", "theirselves", and "hisself", respectively. Interestingly, the traditional "herself" doesn't require this correction. I do this because it makes more sense. The self is the object, and it belongs to them, so it's theirs. Their self. Why do we say "their car" and "their hat", but "themselves"? Imagine how stupid that would sound for anything else.

Be the change that you want to see in the world, and all that.
