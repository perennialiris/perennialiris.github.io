# My anime reviews

.2024-11-02

I'm not that into anime, so it doesn't make a lot of sense for me to rate and review every anime series that I've ever seen, but I'm going to do it anyway. There were a few on TV when I was young that I got into watching (Inuyasha, Sailor Moon); the rest I didn't see til my mid 20s. In total, I'd say I've seen 11.

If you're not into anime, the brief glimpses you get into the anime world can make it seem strange and off-putting. The characters all talk weird, they yell certain lines at random, everybody is an exaggerated stereotype, that girl's breasts are weirdly big and everyone's skirts are weirdly high and those camera angles are really unnecessary. Then somehow the writing and dialogue feels like it was made for kids. It's like a whole genre made by and for horny teenagers.

But as with anything, you have to find *the good stuff*. Most of any category of thing is going to be bad. Like, most books are bad, most movies are bad, most music sucks. Our idea of what's good is relative, and we only ever really like the best of a given category that we find. I say that I like metal music for example, but out of all metal music out there, how much have I heard? I'm probably just listening to the top 5% of it I've come across or something.

I've been pretty careful about what anime series I waste my time with. I try watching one episode, and if it's bad then I just quit. These are all series that were at least tolerable enough for me to keep watching. And then some of them ended up being really good.

## Little Witch Academia (2017)

rating: 3/5 --- length: 25 episodes

||image-span
4-1.png|Akko (right), the main character, and Diana (left), the rival or deuteragonist or something

It has the vibe of the early Harry Potter movies, but if Hogwarts was an all-girls school. Then it goes off in a totally different direction, in terms of characters, theme, and story. The show is often super cheesy, but it's also just one of the most wholesome things I've ever seen, and fortunately it has none of the pervy weirdness featured in a lot of the other anime with teenage girl characters (don't lewd my akko!).

The protagonist is Atsuko (pronounced 'ought-sko') Kagari, known by her nickname Akko ('aw-koh'). I first watched *Little Witch Academia *shortly after it came out during a fairly bad time in my life and this character warmed my stupid heart. She's adorable, guileless, and kind, somebody with a childlike wonder and innocence and curiosity about the world. It's a personality-archetype that many other shows try to pull off, but none as well as this one.

Akko's dream was to attend magic school, and she gets in, which makes her very happy---but then it turns out she's not *good *at school. She falls behind in her classes and she struggles at things that seem to come more naturally to her peers. But she remains positive and perseverant and just keeps trying. I loved her blossoming friends-turned-enemies dynamic with Diana, the uncovering of mysteries about their intertwined past, learning about her hero Shiny Chariot, and the great introduction of a central villain half-way through the series.

For me, a great protagonist is often enough to carry everything else, and I did just love Akko as a protagonist. She *makes* this show. Diana and Croix are great characters too, and the general world that LWA creates is also enjoyable---but overall, I suspect that if you don't appreciate Akko the way that I do, LWA wouldn't be that great critically speaking. Just solid.

## Death Note (2006)

rating: 5/5 --- length: 37 episodes

||image-span
4-2.png|Kira (standing), the main character, and L (sitting), the, er, other main character, I guess

This series is so ubiquitously praised that I wonder if there's anything more I need to say about it. I feel like everybody who's aware of it probably already understands it's good.

*Death Note* is a well-constructed drama with a fascinating premise, and it doesn't fail on the execution. It starts strong, it ends strong, it's strong all the way through. I was truly impressed the first time I saw it, and that's still how I feel now. There's so much back-and-forth intrigue and things change up frequently enough that it never feels stupid or stale. The character's motivations make sense, they do a good enough job answering or covering potential plot-holes for suspension of disbelief, the rules of the world are consistent. It's just incredible.

I've heard some people didn't like the character of Misa Amane because she just felt too unreal, too crazy, too hard to believe and take seriously---but girls like that exist. Hell, I bet a lot of girls who watched *Death Note *would've done what Misa did. Some people are crazy.

The low point of the series is probably that brief window right after that one character's death, and some people say they stop watching at that point. In my opinion, it picks up and ends up being interesting again soon afterwards, and the entire series is worth watching. I think this was the only time I was so hooked by an anime that I binge watched like a dozen episodes at a time on first viewing.

## Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)

rating: 4/5 --- length: 51 episodes

||image-span
4-3.png|The Elric brothers, Alphonse (left, he has no body anymore, his soul is stuck in that suit of armour) and Edward (the series protagonist)
4-4.png|Roy Mustang (left) and Maes Hughes (right), major supporting characters

This was an interesting series. It felt expansive, so many characters and stories and places. What genre do people consider this? It's like those video games that are just called 'action-adventure' for lack of better term. It's 'kid-friendly', but apparently all that means is there's no sex or swearing. It explores some pretty dark and disturbing themes, and I know adults who quit after the chimera dog-girl plot early on. They also *really *tried to hit us in the gut when Hughes died and we had to listen to his daughter crying at the funeral. Like, what the fuck was that?

Edward and Alphonse are well-conceived protagonists, the world felt so varied, and the rules and structure of the fictional world were clearly thought out. There's lots of great twists (like---major spoilers---their dead mother's body still being around as a villain, because it turns out homunculi are created through failed attempts at human transmutation), great characters (*Roy, mon cœur*), but centre stage in what made Fullmetal Alchemist excellent was its excellent overarching story, as their search for the Philosopher's Stone leads them to delve into the history of conflict between their country of Armestris and the neighbouring region of Ishval.

The manga the TV series is based on hadn't finished yet by the time the anime was wrapping up, so the people making the show just had to wing it and make up an ending. And what they came up with was actually fairly good. They added a character named Dante to serve as the final-boss villain, and the plan and motivation that gets revealed is satisfying. Then it gets wild and they leave the anime world and go interact with real-life historical Nazis for some reason, which was surprisingly well-done for how stupid that sounds on paper.

They ended up completely remaking this series in 2009--2010, which was called *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*, incorporating the 'real ending' instead of that Nazi arc, and generally following the manga more closely. That went on to become one of the most highly rated anime series of all time. Maybe I'll watch it someday, but for now my memories of the show are based on the 2003 version.

## Inuyasha (2002)

rating: 3/5 --- length: 167 episodes, then 26 more, and 4 movies

||image-span
4-5.png|Inuyasha and Kagome

First of all, *Inuyasha* has some of the most painfully cringe-inducing dialogue of all time. Nearly every time the main cast is talking to each other, I'm dying of second-hand embarrassment. There's always an awkward, pseudo-romantic tension that you're waiting to break, and it just never does. They're always saying the wrong thing, falling on their face socially. It's just all fucking awkward. That may be partly the localization team's fault, but part of it also feels intentional, because it's part of how we get more invested in the Inuyasha--Kagome ship that always feels just over the horizon. They *must *like each other, but neither of them will say! They're both embarrassed! How long can it go on? Fucking hell.

This is also one of those shows that probably accidentally gave a bunch of the audience fetishes without them realizing it. Inuyasha sort of has a female-dominant pet-play dynamic going on with Kagome, with the brilliant excuse that neither of them signed up for it. In the pilot, Inuyasha is a powerful hanyō (a Japanese word meaning basically a spirit or demon?), but wears a special artefact called the beads of subjugation, allowing Kagome---and only Kagome---to topple him over just by saying 'sit' (get it? because he's a dog). So Kagome, an ordinary and by extension physically weak human with no magical powers or whatever, is the only one who can dominate the otherwise powerful and dominant Inuyasha, and it's important for plot reasons that Inuyasha do anything he can to protect her. Also, they lowkey have feelings for each other, but the writers are just going to go ahead and tease you with that for another 160 episodes.

The world of Inuyasha is awesome. It goes through so many different acts and locations, and they did a great job not only capturing the aesthetic and feel of 'feudal Japan', but making the world these characters inhabit feel *enormous*. I actually don't think it's an easy feat for shows to make their worlds feel big. (For an example of a series that fails at this, look at *Star Wars*. On paper, the world is way bigger than almost any other media, spanning huge areas of space and many different planets, but the stories they tell within the *Star Wars* franchise makes the universe feel very small, because you don't see that many different settings, the same small group of characters all just keep bumping into each other, and travel happens off-screen or in an instant.)

||image-span
4-6.png|Naraku, the main villain guy
4-7.png|Sesshōmaru, Inuyasha's half-brother and main anti-hero guy

I thought about this for a while before committing to this: I really do think **Naraku** (left, with black hair) is the best villain that I've ever seen, ever, in anything. His aesthetic is perfect. He's ominous, manipulative, mysterious, you don't even know who he is at first. And whenever he was around, there was an amazingly iconic and sinister track that would play, which has been etched into my memory ever since.

Here, listen to it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSzVNoX57mA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSzVNoX57mA)

Inuyasha's older brother, **Sesshōmaru** (right, with white hair), is the coolest wandering anti-hero ever. He's extremely stoic and arrogant; he reminds me of a vampire. But he's a peak example of 'anti-hero' as a concept. He's not evil, he's not really good, but he has conflict with Inuyasha, and he spends almost the entire anime basically just wandering around doing his own thing. He has his own personal journey of self-reflection, pondering the purpose of his existence and his place in the world, after his father died and left him an object of healing instead of killing (which he left to Inuyasha---*why, father?*). He ends up sort of 'adopting' this little girl he saves named Rin, in his own confusion, and they develop a funny relationship where she follows him because she has nowhere else to go and she thinks he must be a great guy because he saved her, and he doesn't even really understand why he's taking care of her, he just does.

There's also too many characters for me to go over them all. Kikyo, Sango and Miroku, Shippo. My god, Shippo is great! I love Shippo!

At the end of the day, I don't recommend Inuyasha. Like I said at the start, it's a really awkward show, the dialogue is painful, albeit in sort of a fun way. The story is very expansive, but could also feel drawn out. It's by far the longest anime I've ever sat through. It's a show that I remember positively and its fantasy world and characters have meaningfully stuck with me ever since I first encountered it, but I predict that most people would rate it as 'just okay' and not really worth the time investment given how long it is.

## Cowboy Bebop (1998)

rating: 5/5 --- length: 26 episodes and done (though there's also a movie I didn't see).

||image-span
4-8.png

This is another series that receives what feels like universal praise. I went in with high expectations and---after a few rocky episodes near the beginning (that weird enviro-terrorist episode? and the child who never ages??)---by the ending I wasn't disappointed at all. The pieces came together, and overall they managed to pull off something fantastic.

The world of *Cowboy Bebop *is often described as a 'space Western'. The space part is because it takes place in a pseudo-futuristic world of 2071, where any normal person can buy a small starship and fly to Mars if they feel like it, but our television sets are still bulky and full of vacuum tubes. It's like the *Star Wars* approach to tech, except there's no such thing as 'warp' or faster-than-light travel, meaning nobody is ever getting out of our solar system. The world is realistically gritty and dirty---not dark and dystopian, but balanced, like if there's been relatively little social change from the 1990s (when the series was made).

This type of world has similarities to the early American westward expansion. The structures of our society are spread thin because we're suddenly exploring all this new space and we haven't got a great handle on the available technology yet, so we're suddenly awash in opportunity and resources but also crime and chaos. To compensate for their limited resources while trying to get a handle on organized crime, the police issue bounties for known criminals---and the starting main characters, Spike and Jet, are bounty hunters. They ride around in their small spaceship, which they call the Bebop ('bee-bop'). That's the episode-one premise.

||image-span
4-9.png|A random shot of one of the cities they go to in the show

The music and animation of *Cowboy Bebop *contribute to its unique aesthetic. It has a distinctly artsy, jazzy feel with a wide range of pace, from slower, more solemn moments to action-oriented fights or chases with fast energy. So much effort went into the landscapes and environments, the city streets, and score that *Cowboy Bebop *ends up being impressive purely as a work of art, like the 1988 anime film *Akira*.

As with many shows, *Cowboy Bebop *starts off more episodic, but then after getting comfortable it introduces more overarching elements. Its major theme is one that fits well with the cowboy analogy: the misfit, the wanderer, the person who has nowhere to go, nowhere to go back to. They're lost in the world. That's what the main cast all have in common. And after their paths cross, all they have is each other. For a time, the Bebop becomes home.

Eventually, we learn Spike was once a member of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate, but after getting into a conflict with other members, he ran away and can never go back---their policy is that anybody who leaves the Syndicate must be killed, and he's therefore (to them) a wanted man, indefinitely. Jet, meanwhile, is a former cop who became disillusioned by corruption on the force, leading to other police members betraying and attempting to murder him (he survived, but lost his entire left arm, now replaced with a mechanical one).

A few episodes in they encounter **Faye**, a woman on the run with no memory of who she is or where she came from. She has nothing to go back to. Then they meet Edward---who's *less *of a main character than the other three---a strange teenage girl (who's often mistaken for a boy) who was abandoned by her family and then ran away from the orphanage, with no clear plan for the future and, like the others, nothing secure she could fall back on.

Something else *Cowboy Bebop *does excellently is the characterization of its two male protagonists, Jet and Spike. They're both strong, competent guys with their own ups and downs. I loved their personalities and their enduring friendship.The world *Cowboy Bebop *depicts is rather diverse. I think in the 90s, everybody assumed there would be less racial division in the future, because humanity would all move around and intermingle more. There's a lot of random black and other racial minority characters, and they're all different from each other and overall portrayed reasonably.

A brief part that some people would say hasn't aged as well, which I'm contractually obliged to address, is in the two-parter *Jupiter Jazz*, when Spike encounters a gay male drag queen or crossdresser named Julius. Faye also meets somebody named Gren, who reveals he's gay, and then later it's revealed he has female breasts due to having been forcibly subject to experiment in the past, and he seemingly embraces that? (Faye asks if he's a man or woman, and he answers "I'm both at once and I'm neither one.")

If a Western animation studio were given a script like this today, they would likely have played it more sensitively or delicately---but there was nothing really negative about this episode, and I like how it ended up. It wasn't sugarcoated or walking on eggshells. Neither Gren, Julius, nor the other crossdressers you briefly see are intended to be transgender, at least there's no clear sign of that. It's a guy who was given female hormones against his will, and some gay guys who are crossdressing in a gritty industrial setting. The show doesn't encourage the audience to have a problem with these people. They're simply *portrayed*.

||image-span

In the late 90s, the concept of a trans person didn't really exist yet in popular culture, and especially not in Japan, which is why in some cases there's a lot of discourse and articles about whether a character from some old anime should be understood as trans or not. Let's just appreciate things for being good in their time.

That said, this isn't a big part of the show. What makes *Cowboy Bebop *great is the exploration into the depth of its characters. Spike's, Jet's, and Faye's past lives all come back to haunt them, and they all have to reconcile and decide what's really important to them. It's beautiful.

## The Promised Neverland (2019)

rating: 4/5 --- length: 12 episodes (first season)

||image-span
4-11.png|Those two on the left (Don and Emma) are main characters; those other 6 kids are background characters

I personally found it a little difficult to suspend disbelief about how young these characters were---but if you're willing to tell yourself going in that what you're about to see are the a bunch of genetically engineered super-kids with the intellect, ingenuity, and personalities of gifted university students, *The Promised Neverland* presents an interesting hypothetical scenario with a compelling story therewithin.

Don, Ray, and Emma live in an orphanage, which is in a pastoral setting, out in what seems like basically the middle of nowhere. They don't remember life before the orphanage, and they've never left, so this is the only thing they know. Then, in the first episode, they stumble upon a secret: the orphanage is actually a human-breeding compound, which some kind of demons are using to farm them for consumption. The whole show is about how to escape.

I'm not the only one whom it reminded of Death Note. I also noticed the person who voices Emma in the English dub is the same voice actor who plays Akko in Little Witch Academia, and she just talks the same way in both roles, so it's like, oh, hi Akko. (I only ever watch English dubs. I can't stand listening to Japanese. No, I don't want to argue about it.)

I really appreciate shows that just tell a single, self-contained story and end. It only takes 12 episodes for the kids to escape, and that's it. But then actually they ended up making sequel seasons, which I never watched, so I have no idea how good those are.

## Sailor Moon (1992)

rating: 2/5 --- length: 45 episodes for the main series everybody knows, plus god knows how many more

||image-span
4-12.png|From left to right: Sailor Moon (Serena/Usagi), Sailor Mars (Rei, pronounced Ray), Sailor Jupiter (Lita/Mako), Sailor Venus (Mina/Minako), Sailor Mercury (Ami, pronounced the same as Amy)

I don't know the whole *Sailor Moon* expanded media franchise, only the series that originally broadcast in the West. There were like 45 episodes that introduced the main Sailor Scouts everybody knows (Moon, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter).

The themes and aesthetics of *Sailor Moon* have been crazy influential; she's the quintessential girl-boss girl-power nonsense that predates most other examples you can think of, and it embraces all its own silliness and immaturity.

Usagi (renamed 'Serena' for the English version) dresses up and becomes a super-hero thingy that fights evil because a magical cat showed up one day and told her "hey, you have powers" and she kind of just goes "ok, cool" with not nearly as many questions and concerns as I'd have had. Then at the beginning of encounters with baddies she shouts a bunch of lines that don't sound off-the-cuff, and it's like, girly, who taught you any of this? Was it all in the back of your head, like a sleeper agent waiting to be activated?

Spoilers: yes, basically. She's the reincarnation of the Moon Princess, so it's like on some deep, subconscious level she already knows all of this from a past life; it all just clicks for her.

But Usagi is also just a teenage girl, so she's lazy, whiny, irresponsible, and more like she's playing at being a superhero (even though she literally *is one* and it's *not *just in her imagination). It's all dumb and cheesy but also a lot of fun, but then for a lot of us it's just 90s nostalgia, and one of the first tastes of 'anime' that many people are ever exposed to.

The first English dub was done by DiC Entertainment ('deek'), who made all their own music (and got voice actors who sometimes just shamelessly phoned it in). The result is that when the show was re-dubbed in 2014 by Viz Media ('vizz'), they couldn't use the music from the version that most of us saw on TV growing up. Which is terrible! It actually changes the feeling and energy of the show so much if you just put in a score with a different mood. The only other bad changes were:

* Naru ('Molly'), Usagi's best friend at school, the one with red hair, was given a totally random Brooklyn accent in the DiC dub, even though it's set in Japan and none of her friends or family or *anyone else *sound remotely like that.
It was such a dumb quirk, but it was one we all got to know, and in the Viz dub, they just made her sound like any other random Japanese girl. It felt so wrong to take it away from her.
* Luna, the cat, also had a unique voice in the DiC dub, which gave her a distinct, unique sound, sort of like an old sorcerer or something. In the Viz redub, she, like Molly, just ended up sounding like any other random Japanese girl.
This is probably even worse, because at least Molly just sounding like some random Japanese girl made sense, because she is literally a random Japanese girl. Luna is a magical talking cat.

The other change I hated was the loss of the iconic *Crown Arcade Theme*, which is reused in many episodes of the DiC version. It was amazing---it screamed trouble and hijinx, let's go hit the town and start some mischief or something. Such energy. Taking this music away from the scenes it was used in changed the feed of the show so much. It was often replaced with boring elevator music. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64Cnu9nIzzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64Cnu9nIzzo)

In addition to being girl-boss girl-power female friendship representation, *Sailor Moon *pushed the envelope on queer representation way before it was cool. There was a lesbian couple and a gay male couple and they both got censored in the Western version. The lesbians came a lot later in the show, Sailor Neptune and Uranus, who were clumsily changed to instead be *cousins *instead of female lovers, which just resulted in these scenes with obvious romantic tension that made no sense in context and just ended up making it seem like they were cousins *and *lovers.

||image-span
4-13.png|Sailor Uranus (left) and Neptune (right)
4-14.png|Sailor Uranus (left) and Neptune (right)

Earlier in the series, two of the male villains, Kunzite and Zoisite (pictured below), were very obviously gay for each other, which American broadcasters didn't like. But Zoisite had long hair that was often styled in really feminine ways, so somebody came up with the clever solution of just cast a woman to do his voice, effectively gender-swapping him and making their romance heterosexual. The character looked so effeminate that it worked and many Western viewers didn't realize this tall, flat-chested villainess was a guy.

||image-span
4-15.png|Kunzute (left) and Zoisite (right)
4-16.png|This was supposed to be gay!

A minor gripe is that Lita (Sailor Jupiter) was supposed to be noticeably taller than the others (it's explicitly talked about), but Zoisite towers over her and nobody says anything. They should've added a long where one of the girls says "who was that really tall lady?" or something.

||image-span
4-17.png|Ami, Lita, and Rei (facing away from us)

It also sort of breaks the backstory of the show. Princess Serenity, the Moon Princess, was guarded by the (all-female) Four Guardian Deities and Prince Endymion, of the Earth Kingdom, was guarded by the all-male Shitennou (*Four Heavenly Kings*). Usagi and Mamoru ('Darien' in the English version) were the reincarnations of Serenity and Endymion, and after the moon cats discover them, they became Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask. The Sailor Scouts (changed to 'Sailor Guardians' in the English version) are the reincarnations of the guardian deities, while Queen Beryl's generals are the reincarnations of the heavenly kings.

If you didn't know any of that, I guess maybe you wouldn't think about it while watching, but it's so wrong they ruined the five-versus-five male-versus-female dynamic that was set up, turning one of the four kings into a woman just because they didn't like how flirty Zoisite was.

I loved Lita. My favourite girl. Sorry, I grew up with her name being Lita.

Anyway, *Sailor Moon *is goofy and fun and there's a reason it was so goddamn influential and still has so many people who remember it and are actively fans of it today. But if you're a dude and you're not generally into anime, then you'll probably just find it dumb? Unless you find it funny. Because it is dumb, and it is funny, and that's what's great about it. It's a jam. But critically speaking it's a show with a lot of problems---shallow plots, stupid writing, bad dialogue, bad voice acting, etc.

## Blue Exorcist (2011)

rating: 2/5 --- length: 25 episodes (first season)

||image-span
4-18.png|The main character is the guy who looks like the main character in this picture

I only realized recently they ended up making more seasons of this. It was originally only one season, but then in 2017 they went back and made more. I only know the one.

In some ways, the soul of this show is very typical. It's like somebody made a mash-up by putting all the other anime in a blender. The writing, pacing, animation---like if you coded a game and you just used all the default engine assets.

The main character is a hothead teenage guy named Rin (yeah, like that little girl who travelled with Sesshōmaru in Inuyasha). Rin discovers that he's literally the son of the devil. No, like, literally. But he wants to fight against that and become an exorcist, so he has to go to exorcist school. It's called True Cross Academy. He gets there and it turns out his better-behaved twin brother, Yukio, is already ahead of him and literally a teacher at the school, even though he's also just a teenage guy? Anime.

The head of the school is also a demon, but who chooses to side with the church despite being a demon, so I guess demons are usually bad, but not always? And yeah, the side of good in this show is literally the church, like, the Vatican. There's a handful of personality-archetype side characters. I liked Izumo Kamiki, whom the other characters called polkabrows, because of her weird eyebrows that are like dots.

For the most part, this show was alright. Nothing about it was really *bad*. It just felt unremarkable, so I don't know why you'd watch this when there's so many other better series to watch.

## Puella Magi Madoka Magica (2011)

rating: 3/5 --- length: 12 episodes

||image-span
4-19.png

This looks like it's going to be a typical girl-power show, but then it turns around and puts an actually-dark spin on the whole genre. A little creature approaches Madoka, the titular protagonist, with her meek voice and pink hair, to ask if she wants magical powers---reminiscent of Luna approaching Usagi to give her the magical locket that turns her into Sailor Moon.

This has the aesthetic of a dumb girl-fantasy with an annoying meek protagonist, but then turns out to be a dark spin on the whole genre. There's a magical little creature that approaches a schoolgirl in Japan and asks her if she wants magical powers, reminiscent of Luna approaching Sailor Moon, but then it goes in a whole other direction. It's unique and ominous, the twists are great, and the story has very little fat---finishing up in only 12 episodes, after doing everything it set out to do. I don't even think I should say anything more!

## Fate/Zero (2011)

rating: 2/5 --- length: 25 episodes

||image-span
4-20.png|Irisviel and Kiritsugu Emiya

This is one part of the broader *Fate* series, and the only part I've seen. The background is laughably contrived and strange, so there's some set-up in that first episode, but once you get what the hell is going on, it tells a decent story. There's a magical object called the holy grail, and in addition to it being a wish-granting artefact it seemingly has a soul and will of its own, and it creates this weird rules-based competition between a bunch of noble houses, who fight amongst theirselves and the winner is granted a wish, and this only happens once every couple generations. The way they have to fight is by choosing an historical figure of some kind and summoning them to command, so it's like a weird large-scale Pokémon battle, except you're bossing around Genghis Khan or something.

The thing this show does really well is juggling around a large case of characters who are all interesting and distinct and have to be 'balanced' in some way, since it's an ongoing contest. There's a kid who's basically a deranged serial killer who enjoys gore but somehow they make him likable. The main plot is then all about how this fight plays out.

The people who end up standing out most are Kirei Kotomine (a corrupt priest) and Kiritsugu Emiya (who's not even a direct participant, but an assassin hired to help Irisveil---the master of 'Saber', the spirit of King Arthur---who's a woman, for some reason?). I can't be fucked remembering so many different Japanese names, so I just called Emiya 'smokes' and Kotomine 'priest guy'. The longer the show goes on, the more it seems like the central conflict is about those two. They're both fucked up and you gradually learn they have more backstory than the other characters.

||image-span
4-21.png|Saber and Irisveil

I really liked the side character called Ryūnosuke Uryū, this younger guy, like a teenager I think, who's a literal serial killer and loves blood, guts, gore, killing, and cruelty. It gets him excited and gleeful like a normal kid seeing candy. There was also Waver Velvet, a nerdy kid who gets dealt the most caveman-like of all manly heroes, called 'Rider', the spirit of Alexander the Great. There's a bunch of other things I'm just not going to bother mentioning.

Oh, and then it turns out that Irisveil literally *is *the holy grail, whatever that even means. *Fate/Zero *is **ambitious**---but overall, its story, characters, and dialogue end up being just okay. I liked some aspects of it, but when all is said and done, it wasn't that entertaining, and your time isn't unlimited, so it's not one of the ones that I'd recommend.

## Frieren: Beyond Journey's End (2023)

rating: 5/5 --- length: 28 episodes

This show exceeded my expectations by a lot. I don't even know what I was expecting---I guess something average, and it was far beyond that.

The world of *Frieren *isn't super-exciting or action-packed. It's more existential, contemplative. It reminds me of *Cowboy Bebop* in that way, but happening in a more open fantasy setting, like if that kind of story was told in *Inuyasha*. I actually sort of like how these days we all understand the concept of a fantasy setting with goblins, elves, dwarves, dragons, and dungeons with chests in them, so now shows are just taking that for granted as their starting point and moving right along. Why reinvent the wheel?

Frieren ('free-ren') is an elf mage, and her life far exceeds that of humans---as in we know they can live for thousands of years, at least. This results in a problem, which is outliving almost everybody you get to know. Once upon a time, Frieren went on a typical adventure-quest: a party of a monk, a mage, a warrior, and a dwarf travelled north to beat up the demon king in his ice palace or something. Victory and glory all around. Now it's 80 years later and almost all the humans alive back then have died, and within the first couple episodes, Frieren's human friends die of old age as well. So it's like, okay, now what?

Frieren wanders around in a world of people who all know of the band of heroes who saved the world a couple generations ago, but none of them recognize that one of those heroes is standing right in front of them---and though she's not in hiding, Frieren doesn't chase that glory by going around proudly announcing who she is.

After Himmel, the warrior guy from Frieren's adventuring party, dies, Frieren cries, overcome with the realization that for as much as he meant to her, she never adequately got to know him, due to not valuing her time like the short-lived humans do. She vows that she wants to learn as much about humans as she can, and in the process she comes to realize just how much the humans she's encountered mean to her---especially Himmel.

She then befriends Fern, a young human mage, whom she brings along with her as a travelling companion. This time she does it differently, and her mentorship and friendship with Fern ends up feeling more like two sisters. It's all very endearing.

There's a fair amount more I'm not getting into. The point is *Frieren *captures something very special and that I enjoyed very much. This is the first time in my life that I'm looking forward to a new season of an anime coming out.

**Noteworthy series I watched for a couple episodes and then quit:**

* *Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid* (2017) --- avoid this.
* *Attack on Titan* (2013) --- some people like it, but I thought it was bad.
* *Himouto! Umaru-chan* (2012) --- cancer.
* I watched the first season of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* (2016) with a couple friends. It seemed meh; I didn't find it interesting enough to continue.
* I remember watching episodes of the original *Dragon Ball* (1986) when Goku is a kid. It seemed charming, if a little slow, though I've never gone back and watched all of it (and if memory serves, it's long).
* I watched the first two episodes of *Delicious in Dungeon* (2024). I might end up watching more just because I know a number of people that seem to really love it, but it has that contrived anime awkwardness I normally don't like, so I don't know.
