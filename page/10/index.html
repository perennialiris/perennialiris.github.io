# Poor Things

.2024-10-31

I never really went out to see new movies when I was younger. I had a few movies on tape as a kid and that was it. I don't know why this is the case. By the time I was an adult, people noticed I was missing a lot of cultural references. A friend would say a line from a movie, I wouldn't get it, they'd say "you know, like from (movie)", I'd say I haven't seen it, and if it were a more uncommon title that'd be fine, but there are some movies people just *expect you* to have seen. So if I say I haven't seen Top Gun, the response is "What? How?! How have you never seen Top Gun?!" It's shocking. Unfathomable. *Everybody* is supposed to have seen Top Gun.

I started keeping a list of movies people reacted with *surprise* about me not knowing. I took these to be cultural staples, things that I should probably go back and see if I want to better relate to the other humans. Then at some point, a couple years ago, I started watching all of them, one by one, always with company. I saw over a hundred movies that first year, which is more than I'd seen for my whole life up until that point. It was fascinating, actually. And I developed a sense of what I like and what I don't. I also had the power to confirm things for people by watching things without the bias of nostalgia. For example: yes, the first Star Wars trilogy was solid, and the prequel trilogy was terrible.

I learned that I often don't appreciate tension. In my opinion it's usually not done well. Even movies that are generally highly rated, from *Predator* (1987) to *Oppenheimer* (2023), will try to cash out tension they didn't really earn by just making us wait around while some stressful, chaotic music plays. Too often, I'm just *bored* in a scene like that, because aside from the score going crazy on the violin, *nothing is happening*. Do you remember that scene in *Oppenheimer* where they're waiting to set off the bomb? I get it, a bomb is going to explode, but it was basically just people standing in a room for 60 seconds.

Effective tension requires more investment than movies often have time for. There's great tension in the *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul* series (is there a uniting term for those? the Walter White cinematic universe?) because they're able to build up these characters and situations across many seasons. I remember a scene in where Saul, in his retirement gig as a Cinnabon manager, is sitting on a bench when these two guys walk over and ask if he's "that lawyer from Albuquerque". Saul is hesitant to answer because he doesn't know if they're associated with the people looking for him and he doesn't want any attention. There were no guns or bombs, no crazy aliens or anything. It was just three guys, talking, in a mall. And I felt more dramatic tension in that conversation than throughout the entirety of *Predator* trying to make me care about some dudes wandering around a jungle.

*Star Trek* sometimes tries to pull this off, where the pattern of an episode's story is "the characters go to a place, there's a dangerous thing, we run around for 30 minutes while said thing scares us". It probably *could've* been done right, but it never really was. (The DS9 episode *Empok Nor*, where Garak *becomes* the monster-of-the-week and we get to see the 'other side' of him as a character, was at least vaguely interesting, compared with the ones where the 'monster' is just a one-off thing introduced for the episode.)

What I find most compelling isn't action and choreography but dialogue. I love dramas, because I love intelligent characters talking to each other in rooms. Some of my favourite movies are ***Twelve Angry Men*** (1957), ***A Few Good Men*** (1992), ***Conspiracy*** (2001), and ***Dial M for Murder*** (1954). These all epitomize what I love about film. They're nothing more than a sequence of conversations, like a play. In fact, *Twelve Angry Men* and *Dial M for Murder* were adapted from stage plays (an experienced viewer can feel it), and *Conspiracy* was written by Loring Mandel, who was mostly a playwright. There's no action---practically nothing *happens* aside from words being spoken, and people entering and leaving scenes.

This is also what's compelling about *Games of Thrones* (the early seasons at least) and *Star Trek*. They excelled at character and dialogue. And look, that's not the *only* thing I care about. I enjoyed *Mad Max: Fury Road* (2015) recently. I really loved *Edge of Tomorrow* (2014) and *Taken* (2008). There's probably just something *to* stripping everything else away and forcing writers and directors to focus on dialogue, what matters most.

Until earlier this year, I'd have said my favourite movie was *Dial M for Murder*. It made me curious about other Hitchcock films, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.

Then I saw ***Poor Things*** (2023).

This movie blew away everything else I'd ever seen. I didn't realize I could enjoy something as deeply as I enjoyed it. I was overwhelmed by the time it was over, and I knew that I would end up writing about it someday. *Poor Things* was directed by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos and stars Emma Stone. They had recently worked together on *The Favourite* (2018), which I'd seen recently, where Stone plays the deuteragonist Abigail Hill. That movie was a strange but enjoyable performance, as much as I didn't enjoy its poignant ending. I was unbelievably gay for Rachel Weisz's portrayal of Sarah Churchill, so it hurt when the movie was over and things hadn't worked out for her---even though, *fine*, I suppose they had to do it that way because the whole story is based on actual history and they didn't want to just fanfic the ending for our satisfaction.

*Poor Things*, based on a 1992 novel by Alasdair Gray, is all about **Bella Baxter**. Bella is a form of something I already knew I loved: an outsider looking in, somebody who offers a unique exploration of humanity by trying to *understand* humanity, but without already knowing it through the common foundation that we all have.

This was always a big part of what makes *Star Trek* great: each series in the franchise has had at least one major character like this in its main cast---somebody who's partially like us, but not fully, but they're making an effort to observe and understand us. In the original series there was Spock, a half-human half-alien, whose differences with his otherwise human crew is often the subject of dialogue. *The Next Generation* series gave us Data, an advanced but emotionless android whose goal was to become more human. *Voyager* introduced Seven of Nine, a human who had lost her humanity after being absorbed into a machine collective (the Borg) for decades and was now in the process of being rehabilitated and rediscovering what it means to be human. In *Deep Space Nine* there was Odo, a shapeshifter who could be anything but primarily took on a humanoid form and lived among us, the origin of his own existence a mystery to him. And really, all the alien races, whether major characters or not, empower to some extent for writers to explore humanity from an outsider's perspective, a great and powerful tool of science fiction that not all series utilize to its potential.

These characters are great additions to their respective worlds not just for what they have but for what they *lack*, in whose place there is a delightful, and typically well-meaning, innocence. They make mistakes because they genuinely don't understand things that that you or I take for granted. They ask us questions that we never thought to ask ourselves. They make observations that force us to reëxamine the mundane. And Bella Baxter masterfully embodies this concept. Of those examples I mentioned, it's most reminiscent of Seven of Nine, as they're both humans, but trying to understand theirselves *as* humans. The stories around Seven were often about her introspection, her exploration inward, not just her exploring *our* humanity but her exploring *her own* humanity.

**The movie opens by showing us Bella's origin**---a pregnant young woman dies; her body was salvageable, but her brain was not, and the baby wasn't yet viable outside of utero. Godwin Baxter realizes the only way to end up with a living person at the end of the day would be to save the baby's brain by putting it in the adult body, which he does, and so Bella is 'born'. We then see Bella grow up on this private estate under Godwin's supervision. These early scenes are shot in black and white with unusual camerawork and are very much reminiscent of *The Miracle Worker* (1962), the movie about Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan.

Emma Stone does a wonderful job giving Bella childish mannerisms, a stilted and unsteady gait, making believable this premise of an adult body with a mind that is still new to this world---she hasn't fully 'learned' how to pilot herself, how to walk around in a cool, natural way. Throughout the film she gets better at walking, and speaking. In the beginning of this movie this continues until she eventually discovers her own sexuality, first masturbating and then beginning to lust for people around her.

This is where some people had some difficulty. There was even criticism online that implied it was trying to push a perverse agenda, i.e. helping to gradually normalize, destigmatize, or demystify pedophilia by displaying sexual acts with an adult-bodied, child-brained person. Which, yes, I might mention---there's just straight-up sex scenes, nothing remotely subtle or hidden, and they start somewhat abruptly.

There's deliberate time ambiguity at play. We're not sure how long Bella has been living at Godwin's estate between her creation and the first time she figures out that she can masturbate. On first viewing, my interpretation was that it had been years. It's shown that Godwin had grown especially close with and emotionally attached to Bell, which presumably took some time.

The film also makes a point to say that Bella is growing and maturing at a faster rate than normal people do. This felt plausible enough---did you know that children who go through puberty too early (precocious puberty) become more intelligent sooner than children who don't? They don't end up more intelligent after their peers have matured; they just reach their own peak earlier. And perhaps being put in an adult body is the equivalent of that. It's a fantasy based on medical science that is, as far as I'm aware, fictitious, meaning there is some suspension of disbelief about the mechanics of how it would play out.

For me, the scene where Bella discovers her own sexuality represented her reaching the maturity equivalent of a young teenager, as her version of hitting puberty and touching herself. And then more time passes between then and her engaging sexually with any other person.

It's also set in the past. No exact year is given, but probably the late 19th Century. The age at which it was socially acceptable for a young woman to have sex used to be different---an example that comes to mind for me is that in *Pride and Prejudice*, Lydia was only 16 years old by the time she ran off to elope with Wickham. Though her family was unhappy with the match for other reasons, Lydia wasn't considered too young to elope. Lydia also remarked that she thought 23 was too old an age at which to still be unmarried.

How 'old' was Bella, spiritually, by the time she had sex for the first time? Old enough that it's not uncomfortable, is my answer---and certainly a world away from the writers trying to imply anything remotely malicious. It rather has the opposite effect. The audience is left feeling that her situation was, at best, not quite right.

It's also not as though we're meant to think of these men as paragons of morality. Duncan (Mark Ruffalo's character) only took Bella with him because he thought she would be easily manipulated, and he could have sex with her and eventually ditch her. He thought she would be an obedient toy and he was surprised---and fascinated---when she turned out to be so much more than that. Godwin isn't a malicious or amoral person---though he does ethically dubious things, he has his own internal justification for his actions, and he feels he did the right thing by allowing Bella to live---but he's also a tortured mess, not meant to be an ideal person.

I feel Max wouldn't have done anything at all had Bella not come onto him first. And when she did, he hesitates. He knows Bella's origin. They both knew that she's vulnerable and ignorant of the world, and how incapable she would be if they sent her off on their own---yet there is a conflict in their mind. When Max looks at her, he can't help but see a fully grown woman, because that's what she is physically, and he feels attracted to her despite what he *knows* about her.

All three men come to love Bella more than they anticipated, and that love only became stronger the more time went by, the more she developed. What was so charming about Bella? It can't just be that she was physically beautiful---not for the unique sort of affection she so strongly inspired in people, which came only *after* observing her personality. Her charm was her oddity, her lack of mundanity. Here you have a person who isn't like all the others you've met before. There is something pure about her, uncorrupted, she's fun, curious, for her every experience is a novel one. She doesn't know all those things *everyone knows*, and she hasn't learned all the rules and expectations that come with being in broader society.

There is something remarkable about a person who agrees to be a prostitute when she wanted money, not out of desperation, but because to her it sounded like a fine arrangement. The only sex she had ever known was a great experience with somebody who loved her, so she gets to do something enjoyable and then also get paid? *What's the downside?* Then reality hits her. Instead of running away, she tries to make the best of her own situation, and her perseverance is endearing. She has no shame, no disgust, she is totally free and unrestrained by social pressure that most people are plagued by at all times. Emma Stone talks about how attractive it was to play a character who was so intrinsically *liberated*.

There was some discourse about whether *Poor Things* was intended to soften our view of sex work, perhaps even endorse it, or implicitly encourage women to consider it as a valid means of pursuing money and independence. What I saw portrayed was rather the opposite: somebody who only ended up wandering into sex work because she had no expectations, and quickly discovering just how unpleasant, degrading, and *uninteresting* sex can be when there is no spark, no connection, no love to drive your participation. It becomes impersonal, mechanical, and it ends and begins abruptly.

In one very lovely scene---and it's incredible that I could refer to it as 'lovely' considering the setting---Bella meets with a customer in the brothel, but then stops and, pretending to be carrying out some kind of official change in procedure (rather than her personal idea), she requests the man recall and share a memory he enjoys, and allow her to share with him a joke. They stop, sit, talk, and laugh. *Then* they fuck. It's not the most romantic story of the ages, but it's Bella's attempt at making the experience less meaningless by getting to know him and making some kind of actual human connection where you feel something about one another other than lust.

*Poor Things* might also be the funniest movie that I've ever seen, not excluding the comedies. It first creeps in during the second act on the voyage with Duncan. There is a dry, sudden, unexpected humour to so many lines that feel out of place, that are delivered so peculiarly, that create absurdity and break tension, like Duncan dryly observing "that woman's on fire, look" in the tone you might expect somebody to mumble they need to take the garbage out; to sharp turns that take you off guard, like when Duncan says Godwin "coughs not air as a normal human, but blood" and Max replies "he has cancer, you fucking idiot". But most of the humour comes from Bella herself, who has similarly sudden and absurd lines, like matter-of-factly describing people off the top of her head for lack of better way of referring to them (e.g. calling a woman 'strange feathered lady' because her dress had feathers).

Her interactions with Duncan are a *delight*---all the little things he expects her to know that she doesn't, the situations he expects her to handle and navigate normally but instead she acts impulsively and does as she pleases. It somehow had never struck Duncan that nobody ever taught this woman proper dinner-table manners. Bella's approach lacks any thoughtful nuance: this thing is bad, so I want it out of my mouth. That thing tastes good, so I want more of it. What nonsense, that you must keep a bad-tasting thing in your mouth anyway? What is normal is insane and unreasonable.

There's also something special about Bella replying---to Duncan, angrily telling her what she's done---"A recounting of events... the point of which is elusive to me". The uncertainty in her voice, the genuine confusion, the *suspicion*, the fact she started this sentence before she knew how to end it, the fact she doesn't even seem to understand the importance of the fact she'd run away with Max? And her expressing it in a way that is at once very direct (telling Duncan she doesn't understand the point of what he's saying) but also very verbose (she could have just said 'so?').

Bella's friendship with Harry and Martha was a means to heighten conflict with Duncan (her being influenced by other people, rather than only him)---but this is also about her losing her innocence, maturing, becoming aware of the world and all its faults. She wakes up, abruptly, to how much more there is than what she's seen. I feel like Martha gave Bella a moment of sudden awareness about the reality of aging, the idea that she might one day no longer want or value the things she does now---or maybe I'm thinking too much about that.

In France, Bella befriends Toinette, a black French woman also working as a prostitute. They spend time together, she tells Bella about socialism (sort of randomly---it doesn't really go anywhere, but it's briefly mentioned, probably just to help set that socialism was an idea popular with the French working class at the time), and they develop a sexual relationship as well.

In the third act, Bella is tracked down by Alfie, her mother's husband---i.e. the man who married and impregnated the body Bella now inhabits. So, her father? But from Bella's perspective, she treats her mother not as her mother, but as her past self. She seems to view Alfie not as her father, but as the man *she* had been with, in a past life. Out of curiosity, she goes with him, to see what that life would have been like. It turns out to be terrible. Bella learns the death of her 'mother' was a suicide, and she quickly understands why. The story ends soon after.

In the end, *Poor Things* is an adventure of wonder, of empowerment, of finding your own way in a world despite all that's put in front of you. It's whimsical, it's bizarre, it's endearing, it tries to do many different things at once and it succeeds at all of them. It's probably not for everyone, but I don't care. I still can't recommend it enough.

For the rest of my life, I'm going to insist on reacting with surprise whenever anybody tells me they haven't seen *Poor Things*, to make them think they ought to see it too.

*I'll attach some stills from the film.*
