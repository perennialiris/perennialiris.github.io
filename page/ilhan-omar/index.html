# Ilhan Omar

.2025-08-25

After she was elected in 2019, as the first Muslim Congresswoman (along with Rashida Tlaib), there were quickly lies and targetted smears about Ilhan Omar, many amplified by Donald Trump and Fox News, who talked about and focused on her far more than any left-wing media did. It makes sense why Trump---whose audience cheered when he talked about wanting to ban all Muslims from the country---was happy to put a racist spotlight on the only person in government wearing a hijab. But did you end up believing any of the claims about her back as well?

A common point of outrage early on was the idea that Ilhan tried to downplay 9/11 by referring to it in passing by saying "some people did something"---but this wasn't her intention. The [whole speech it came from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INpvY0J0RI) is available online, and her phrasing was: "because **some people** did something, **all of us** were starting to lose access to our civil liberties". If you think it should've been worded more carefully, that's trivially agreeable: it was an off-the-cuff remark in a long speaking event that was primarily about something else.

A rumour that spread was Ilhan married her brother to help him commit immigration fraud. This was a baseless lie being spread by people in Minnesota, but [repeated by Trump](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/send-her-back-trump-manages-take-american-politics-new-low-msna1254071) and others on the right. We know the family history of Ilhan's partners and of all her siblings.

Then in early 2024, a more complicated story spread online: that [Omar gave speech to Somalis in her district in Minnesota]](https://twitter.com/MarinaMedvin/status/1751751864167661750) wherein she says she's working in Congress to "represent the interests of Somalia" and that she was "Somalian first, Muslim second". A video of her speech circulated online with English subtitles that I recorded as such:

||indent
We, as Somalians, we love each other. There are areas of friction and that led us to kill each other, but in reality we are an organized society, brothers and sisters, people of the same blood, people who know they are **Somalians first, Muslims second**, who protect one another, come to each other's aid and to the aid of other Muslims too.
A couple of days ago, we heard some people who call theirselves Somalis have signed an MoU [memorandum of understanding] with Ethiopia on access to the sea. Many Somalians have personally called me to encourage me to speak to the US government and help Somalia. They wanted to know what the US government could do for Somalia to ensure the MoU never turns into a full bilateral agreement.
My answer to Somalians was that the US government will only do what Somalians in the US tells them to do. They will do what we want and nothing else. They must follow our orders and that is how we will safeguard the interest of Somalia. We Somalians must have that confidence in ourselves that we call for the shots in the US. We live in the US, pay taxes in the US and have a real voice.
The US is a country where one of your daughters is in congress to represent your interest, for as long as I am in the US Congress, Somalia will never be in danger, its waters will not be stolen by Ethiopia or others. The US would not dare to support anyone against Somalia to steal our land or oceans. Sleep in comfort, knowing **I am here to protect the interests of Somalia from inside  the US system.**
The woman you sent to Congress is working day and night to protect your interest, she knows your plight and that of Somalia. I am as concerned about Somalia as you guys are. Together we will protect the interests of Somalia.
President Hassan Sheikh has done a remarkable job in looking after Somalia. Mr. President, you have done an excellent job and we are happy about it. You spoke to Somalians dispersed across the world that you are there to look after Somalia. However weak it is, or if it is a failed state, we Somalians are resilient people who can fight against all odds, people who love their country, we are people who will never allow someone else to steal our land.
--- Ilhan Omar (per viral Twitter translation)

Ilhan Omar replied calling this translation inaccurate, ["not only slanted but completely off"](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1751719238316724330). She also notes that people from Somalia [are called Somalis, not Somalians](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1752094934759358560)---a hint that whoever made the viral translation was somebody not too familiar with the Somali language.

A local outlet called the Minnesota Reformer [looked into this and reported that](https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/01/republicans-smeared-ilhan-omar-over-a-faulty-translation-heres-what-she-really-said/) according to their translators, the first section of the translation embedded in the viral video was mistranslated at key points: she didn't say "Somalians first, Muslim second"; it was just "Somali and Muslim". There was no mention of order, nor the implied meaning in English when you say something is "first" (which implies primacy over the things that follow). Whoever made the video inserted that phrasing to incite a social media backlash.

I saw another Somali user named Abdirahid Hashi who [posted what he claims is a more accurate translation](https://x.com/AnalystSomalia/status/1752061355530571978) of what Ilhan can be heard saying in the video:

||indent
We Somalis are people who love each other. It is possible that some of us are rough with each other, but when the going gets tough, we are people who have each other's backs. We are sisters and brothers, supporting each other, people who know they are Somalis and Muslims, coming to each other's aid and aiding their brothers and sisters.
And the other day, when we heard that some Somalis, or those who say they are Somalis, entered an MoU with Ethiopia, many people called me and said, "Ilhan, you should talk to the US government; what is the US government going to do about this?"
My response was: the US government will do what we ask it to do. We should have this confidence in ourselves as Somalis. We live in this country. We are taxpayers in this country. This country is one where one of your daughters sits in Congress. While I am in Congress, no one will take Somalia's sea. The United States will not back others to rob us. So, do not lose sleep over that, O Minnesotans. The lady you sent to Congress is on this, and she is as cognizant of this interest as you are.
I would like to tell President Hassan Sheikh that we are impressed with the great work you have done. You have made it known to those living in Somalia and other places that, in spite of the many challenges we face as Somalis, we are nonetheless competent people. People who believe in their country and will not allow it to be endangered. 
Thus, I want to congratulate the Somalis in Minnesota and everywhere on how united you are. How you all stood by our president, because he needs our solidarity. Somalia belongs to all Somalis. Somalia is one. We are brothers and sisters, and our land will not be balkanized. Our lands were taken from us before, and God willing, we may one day seek them, but what we have now will not be balkanized.
I thank you all for how you always welcome me and honor me; may the Lord honor you. Peace and blessings of God be with you.
--- Ilhan Omar (according to Somali translator)

It's still possible to criticize this if you're against "hyphenated Americans"---i.e. if you believe an immigrant should not feel any lingering investment in or connection to their country of origin. But is this a realistic demand, and is it something applied fairly to people of other backgrounds; or is it something Ilhan Omar is being hit with harder than other people would because of the specific identity that she possesses?

Numerous right-wing figures reacted very strongly to the faulty translation of Ilhan's statements:

* Tom Emmer, a Congressman from Minnesota, called on her to redesign.
* Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, [said she should be forcibly expelled from Congress, lose her citizenship, and be deported](https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1752351036914667642).
* Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, [called her a terrorist sympathizer](https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1751806266651897869), said she's [acting as a foreign agent](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13034035/marjorie-taylor-greene-ilhan-omar-foreign-agent-somalia.html), introduced [a motion in the House to censure her](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4442166-greene-omar-censure-force-vote/), and likewise said that Omar should be stripped of citizenship and deported.

Take a moment to reflect on the situation here. Ilhan Omar has been a citizen for 20 years, has spent the vast majority of life in America, and was democratically elected to a seat in Congress---but if she says one thing they don't like, these Republicans think it's appropriate to unseat her, take her citizenship, and deport her.

Asked for comment about Greene, Omar said "I have nothing to say about the insanity of that woman"---an understatement.

## What kind of person is Ilhan Omar?

The common perception or fear is that Ilhan secretly resents America, doesn't support American values, and is just trying to use America for the benefit of her group---whether that means her fellow Muslims, her fellow Somalis, or both.

I was curious about what kind of person she is. I listened to her speeches, read through interviews, and even got a copy of her 2020 book, a memoir about her life called *This Is What America Looks Like: My Journey from Refugee to Congresswoman*.

Ilhan's father was an officer in the Somali military, educated in Russia. He rose to the rank of colonel by the end of his military career when he and their family fled the country. At that time, most of Somalia was still an agrarian society where life revolved around clan structure. Ilhan's family was comparatively upper class, egalitarian, and Western-influenced. She grew up surrounded by books and culture in a home she describes as a compound. She spent her free time watching Bollywood films and listening to BBC News.

Going against the stereotype of this part of the world, Ilhan's maternal grandfather believed in equality for girls and women, and their family's inner dynamic was unusual for a Somali family, which is typically more strict and hierarchical. Though Ilhan's mother died when she was very young, her mother's side of her family came from an ethnic minority in Somalia called the Benadiri, for which Ilhan recalls she wasn't considered fully Somali by those who knew of their background. The only place she fully fit in was within the walls of her family's home.

In [an interview Ilhan did with a magazine called The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/podcast/politics/ilhan-omar-next-left-politics/) in 2019, she says her family had a complete distaste for the spread of Wahhabism in Somalia. That makes sense: they were moderate, educated Sunnis---not attracted to the sort of reactionary extremism that draws people in during periods of conflict.

In America, Ilhan's father found that, like many refugees, the status he had in their former country didn't translate to status here. He found work as a cab driver while his children tried to adapt. Ilhan was sent to a public school alone, not able to speak any English. But she quickly learned, and went on to do well in school, attend university, get involved in local political campaigns, get elected as a state-level lawmaker (2017--2019), and then in 2019 get elected as the first Somali member of Congress.

Ilhan isn't coming for your freedom of speech or trying to pass blasphemy laws. When she talks passionately about America, it's because she's defending your constitutional rights and rule of law, and opposing what she sees as democratic backsliding and increasing militarism. Like other immigrants from war-torn countries, she must feel some dread when it feels as though America is sliding in the wrong direction, becoming more and more like the place her family fled.

If you don't hate all Muslims but you're worried about radical Islam in the Muslim community pulling people toward extremism and in an anti-American direction, then you should put down the pitchfork and be happy to have a leader like Ilhan Omar as an ally.

Abdirashid Hashi
@AnalystSomalia
For those seeking an accurate and verbatim translation of what Congresswoman @Ilhan
 said, here it is:

[The context is: she was addressing her Somali-American constituents, who were alarmed by Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed’s announcement of his intention to assist a region/province in Somalia in becoming a sovereign state. Additionally, he stated he will acquire land and sea l for his landlocked country through this province. Somalia, the African Union, the USA, the European Union, the UK, and the global community stand with Somalia, stating that dismembering Somalia and annexing its land is unacceptable]

Here is what the Congresswoman said:

------------------------------------------------

“We Somalis are people who love each other. It is possible that some of us are rough with each other, but when the going gets tough, we are people who have each other’s backs. We are sisters and brothers, supporting each other, people who know they are Somalis and Muslims, coming to each other’s aid and aiding their brothers and sisters.

And the other day, when we heard that some Somalis, or those who say they are Somalis, entered an MoU with Ethiopia, many people called me and said, “Ilhan, you should talk to the US government; what is the US government going to do about this?”

My response was: the US government will do what we ask it to do. We should have this confidence in ourselves as Somalis. We live in this country. We are taxpayers in this country. This country is one where one of your daughters sits in Congress. While I am in Congress, no one will take Somalia’s sea. The United States will not back others to rob us. So, do not lose sleep over that, O Minnesotans. The lady you sent to Congress is on this, and she is as cognizant of this interest as you are.

I would like to tell President Hassan Sheikh that we are impressed with the great work you have done. You have made it known to those living in Somalia and other places that, in spite of the many challenges we face as Somalis, we are nonetheless competent people. People who believe in their country and will not allow it to be endangered. 

Thus, I want to congratulate the Somalis in Minnesota and everywhere on how united you are. How you all stood by our president, because he needs our solidarity. Somalia belongs to all Somalis. Somalia is one. We are brothers and sisters, and our land will not be balkanized. Our lands were taken from us before, and God willing, we may one day seek them, but what we have now will not be balkanized. 

I thank you all for how you always welcome me and honor me; may the Lord honor you. Peace and blessings of God be with you.
