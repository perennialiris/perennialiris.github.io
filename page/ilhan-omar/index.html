omar-1.png|Ilhan Omar

After being elected in 2019 as the first Muslim Congresswoman (tied with Rashida Tlaib), there were quickly lies and targetted smears about Ilhan Omar, many of them amplified by Donald Trump and Fox News, who both talked about and focused on her far more than left-wing media did.

A common point of outage was the idea that **Ilhan tried to downplay the 9/11 attacks by referring to them as "some people doing something"**. This was not her intention. You can listen to [the whole speech it came from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INpvY0J0RI) to judge for yourself. The phrasing was "because some people did something, all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties". She was speaking about the collective fear and anxiety Muslims felt after 9/11, when they became suspect by their fellow Americans, and her point was the changing scope: because **some people** did something bad, **all of us** were at risk. If you think it should've been worded more carefully, that's trivial: it was an off-the-cuff remark in a long speaking event, and something she only ever said once.

A rumour also spread around that time was  that **Ilhan illegally married her brother to help him commit immigration fraud.** This was a baseless lie, possibly being spread by people in Minnesota who wanted to hamstring Omar's career, or *maybe* originating with people on a web forum who didn't understand how Arabic names work. Either way, [Trump carelessly repeated it](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/send-her-back-trump-manages-take-american-politics-new-low-msna1254071) and it got some coverage in right-wing media for a time.

In early 2024, after it had been a while since I last heard about Omar, there was another controversy when it was widely claimed that she said she was working in Congress to "represent the interests of Somalia" and that she was ["Somalian first, Muslim second".](https://twitter.com/MarinaMedvin/status/1751751864167661750) On social media, users shared a video of her giving a speech in Somali, with English captions that I recorded as:

||indent
We, as Somalians, we love each other. There are areas of friction and that led us to kill each other, but in reality we are an organized society, brothers and sisters, people of the same blood, people who know they are **Somalians first, Muslims second**, who protect one another, come to each other's aid and to the aid of other Muslims too.
A couple of days ago, we heard some people who call theirselves Somalis have signed an MoU [memorandum of understanding] with Ethiopia on access to the sea. Many Somalians have personally called me to encourage me to speak to the US government and help Somalia. They wanted to know what the US government could do for Somalia to ensure the MoU never turns into a full bilateral agreement.
My answer to Somalians was that the US government will only do what Somalians in the US tells them to do. They will do what we want and nothing else. They must follow our orders and that is how we will safeguard the interest of Somalia. We Somalians must have that confidence in ourselves that we call for the shots in the US. We live in the US, pay taxes in the US and have a real voice.
The US is a country where one of your daughters is in congress to represent your interest, for as long as I am in the US Congress, Somalia will never be in danger, its waters will not be stolen by Ethiopia or others. The US would not dare to support anyone against Somalia to steal our land or oceans. Sleep in comfort, knowing **I am here to protect the interests of Somalia from inside  the US system.**
The woman you sent to Congress is working day and night to protect your interest, she knows your plight and that of Somalia. I am as concerned about Somalia as you guys are. Together we will protect the interests of Somalia.
President Hassan Sheikh has done a remarkable job in looking after Somalia. Mr. President, you have done an excellent job and we are happy about it. You spoke to Somalians dispersed across the world that you are there to look after Somalia. However weak it is, or if it is a failed state, we Somalians are resilient people who can fight against all odds, people who love their country, we are people who will never allow someone else to steal our land.
--- Ilhan Omar (per viral Twitter translation)

Ilhan Omar replied by calling this translation inaccurate---["not only slanted but completely off"](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1751719238316724330). She also notes that people from Somalia [are called Somalis, not Somalians](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1752094934759358560), a possible hint that whoever made the viral translation was somebody not that familiar with the Somali language.

A local outlet called the Minnesota Reformer [pointed out](https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/01/republicans-smeared-ilhan-omar-over-a-faulty-translation-heres-what-she-really-said/) the first section of the viral transcript is mistranslated at a key point, which seems deliberate: she didn't say "Somalians first, Muslim second". It was just "Somali and Muslim". There was no order, nor the implied meaning in English when you say something is "first" (which implies primacy over the things that follow). It seems that whoever made that translation inserted this phrasing to make the soundbite that spread across social media in the form of headlines that most people wouldn't bother looking into.

A Somali user named Abdirahid Hashi [posted what he claims is a more reasonable translation](https://x.com/AnalystSomalia/status/1752061355530571978) of what Ilhan said:

||indent
We Somalis are people who love each other. It is possible that some of us are rough with each other, but when the going gets tough, we are people who have each other's backs. We are sisters and brothers, supporting each other, people who know they are Somalis and Muslims, coming to each other's aid and aiding their brothers and sisters.
And the other day, when we heard that some Somalis, or those who say they are Somalis, entered an MoU with Ethiopia, many people called me and said, "Ilhan, you should talk to the US government; what is the US government going to do about this?"
My response was: the US government will do what we ask it to do. We should have this confidence in ourselves as Somalis. We live in this country. We are taxpayers in this country. This country is one where one of your daughters sits in Congress. While I am in Congress, no one will take Somalia's sea. The United States will not back others to rob us. So, do not lose sleep over that, O Minnesotans. The lady you sent to Congress is on this, and she is as cognizant of this interest as you are.
I would like to tell President Hassan Sheikh that we are impressed with the great work you have done. You have made it known to those living in Somalia and other places that, in spite of the many challenges we face as Somalis, we are nonetheless competent people. People who believe in their country and will not allow it to be endangered. 
Thus, I want to congratulate the Somalis in Minnesota and everywhere on how united you are. How you all stood by our president, because he needs our solidarity. Somalia belongs to all Somalis. Somalia is one. We are brothers and sisters, and our land will not be balkanized. Our lands were taken from us before, and God willing, we may one day seek them, but what we have now will not be balkanized.
I thank you all for how you always welcome me and honor me; may the Lord honor you. Peace and blessings of God be with you.
--- Ilhan Omar (according to Somali translator)

It's still possible to criticize this if you're against "hyphenated Americans", i.e. if you believe an immigrant should not feel any lingering investment in or connection to their country of origin. But is this a realistic demand, and is it something applied fairly to people of other backgrounds; or is it something Ilhan Omar is being hit with harder than other people would because of the specific identity that she possesses?

Numerous right-wing figures reacted very strongly to the faulty translation of Ilhan's statements:

* Tom Emmer, a Congressman from Minnesota, called on her to redesign.
* Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, [said she should be forcibly expelled from Congress, lose her citizenship, and be deported](https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1752351036914667642).
* Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, [called her a terrorist sympathizer](https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1751806266651897869), said she's [acting as a foreign agent](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13034035/marjorie-taylor-greene-ilhan-omar-foreign-agent-somalia.html), and introduced [a motion in the House to censure her](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4442166-greene-omar-censure-force-vote/), and likewise said that Omar should be stripped of citizenship and deported.

Take a moment to reflect on the situation here. Ilhan Omar has been a citizen for 20 years, has spent the vast majority of life in America, and was democratically elected to a seat in Congress---but if she says one thing they don't like, these Republicans think it's appropriate to unseat her, take her citizenship, and deport her.

Asked for comment about Greene, Omar said "I have nothing to say about the insanity of that woman"---an understatement.

---

In the process of reading about Ilhan Omar, I became more curious about her as a person. Does she actually hate America and want to undermine it for the benefit of Muslims or Somalis? That's what some people seem afraid of. I listened to her speeches, watched her media appearances, read through interviews, and even got a copy of her 2020 memoir, *This Is What America Looks Like: My Journey from Refugee to Congresswoman*.

Ilhan's maternal grandfather, Fahduma Abukar, went to university in Italy, then returned to Somalia and became director of the National Marine Transport. Against the norm in his country, Abukar believed in equality for women and girls. He was very influential in Ilhan's life. Her mother's family was part of an ethnic minority in Somalia called the Benadiri, who descend from Arab traders that settled on the southern Somalian coastline.

Ilhan's father, Nur Omar (like Newark without the -k), was an officer in the Somali military, educated in Russia. He rose to the rank of colonel by the end of his military career in 1991, when he and their family fled the country. At this time, much of Somalia was still an agrarian society, and life revolved around clan structure. They cared a lot about your local family and ethnic ties, and there were strong norms about who you could marry, and how your family was supposed to be structured and operate. It was all very old-school. Ilhan's family was, by comparison, upper class, egalitarian, and Western-influenced. Ilhan grew up surrounded by books and culture in a home she describes as a compound. Her mother died when she was very young, but she was influenced by older brothers, her father, and her grandfather. She recalls watching Bollywood films and BBC news, learning about other places in the world. Her family's internal dynamic was unusual for a Somali family, typically strict and hierarchical. They were more open---everybody could speak and felt involved in decision-making, even Ilhan, despite being a girl and the youngest of seven siblings.

Ilhan says the only place she fully fit in was within the walls of her family's home. Her mother's ethnicity resulted in her not being considered "fully Somali" by people who knew her background. She wasn't a submissive, traditional girl, going out and playing soccer and climbing trees. Her "tomboy ways" caused people in her neighbourhood to look down on her, and connected her behaviour with her not having a mother to teach her properly.

In an interview Ilhan did with a magazine called The Nation in 2019, she says her family had a "complete distaste" for the spread of Wahhabism in Somalia. Wahhabism is a more strict, radical form of Islam, a revival movement that wants to go back to the "old ways". Her family were educated, moderate Sunnis, not the sort of people to be attracted to reactionary extremism that draws people in during periods of conflict.

In 1991, the Somali dictatorship, led by Siad Barre, fell. Ilhan's home was attacked, and her family fled to elsewhere within the city. She calls the adults around her saying "I don't understand how everything just turned". Ilhan, then 8 years old, was instructed she had to hide who she was, because members of her father's clan were being targeted. Rebel leaders broadcast on the radio their plans to enact an ethnic cleansing of the region. Normal people who had once lived as neighbours turned against and murdered one another.

Ilhan's family fled south, to a refugee camp in Kenya. They stayed there for four years, sometimes at conflict with the local Kenyans, before coming to America in 1995. Ilhan came to the camp at age 8, and was 13 by the time they left.

Once in America, Ilhan's father, Nur, found that like many refugees, the status he had in their former country didn't translate to status here, and he found work as a cab driver. But they appreciated the life they had. At least they were safe. And he got to watch proudly as his daughter grew up, did well in school, and became the first Somali member of Congress. He was there in person when she was sworn in with Nancy Pelosi in 2019.

When she arrived in America, Ilhan recalls accompanying her grandfather to political events, to help as his translator slash interpreter. It was unlike the political process they knew in Somalia. She said of the contrast that "in America, you could be involved in a political party and you didn't have to be a member of a specific class". Inspired by her family and confident in herself, she went on to attend university in North Dakota, got a degree in political science, and worked as a community educator, helping new Americans in immigrant communities learn about finance and education.

Then she got involved in local politics. She became a campaign manager for a Minneapolis city councillor in 2013. Another six years later, and she ran for office herself and won, lifted up by her community as the voice they wanted to speak for her in government. And that's a role she fulfils not an Islamist, but as a compassionate, progressive liberal, who knows how to speak to and for her Somali community.

Ilhan isn't trying to undermine America. Listen to her when she speaks about the country, or when she speaks out against Trump, and what do you hear? Is she trying to take away your freedom of speech to insult the Quran? Is she complaining that America is too free, too liberal, or that it has too much democracy? No. Not at all. She talks passionately about rule of law, constitutional rights, and opposing militarism. When she says America was a beacon of hope, she means it. Think about the anxiety that immigrants her must experience when they look around in this country they used to look up to, and they feel like now it's starting to slide in the wrong direction, becoming more and more like the places they fled.

Throughout this process, getting to know Ilhan Omar, I've really come to like her. And it's interesting to think I'd have likely never bothered learning so much about her if not for these people attacking her and lying about her online. And I feel some responsibility to talk about it because, at least at first, I kind of fell for it. I didn't go crazy the way some people did, but there was a period of a few months at least, before I went back and dug deeper, where I felt something negative about Omar, a woman I knew nothing about. And she didn't deserve even that.

And I wanted to talk about it because there must beo ther people out there who had a similar experience, who were misled by something they saw about her once but who never went back and corrected the record.

Cheers.

@AnalystSomalia
For those seeking an accurate and verbatim translation of what Congresswoman @Ilhan
 said, here it is:

[The context is: she was addressing her Somali-American constituents, who were alarmed by Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed’s announcement of his intention to assist a region/province in Somalia in becoming a sovereign state. Additionally, he stated he will acquire land and sea l for his landlocked country through this province. Somalia, the African Union, the USA, the European Union, the UK, and the global community stand with Somalia, stating that dismembering Somalia and annexing its land is unacceptable]

Here is what the Congresswoman said:

————————————————

“We Somalis are people who love each other. It is possible that some of us are rough with each other, but when the going gets tough, we are people who have each other’s backs. We are sisters and brothers, supporting each other, people who know they are Somalis and Muslims, coming to each other’s aid and aiding their brothers and sisters.

And the other day, when we heard that some Somalis, or those who say they are Somalis, entered an MoU with Ethiopia, many people called me and said, “Ilhan, you should talk to the US government; what is the US government going to do about this?”
