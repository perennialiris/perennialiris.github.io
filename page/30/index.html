# India

. original 2024-03-05, revised 2025-10-24

There's been a lot of racism directed at Indians in recent years. In Canada, they're one of the main immigrant groups that our country has been receiving, so anybody who wants to translate their anti-immigration feelings into racism will often pick Indians as their main target. It's been increasingly overt and uncomfortable. When I was younger, mention of an Indian immigrant was more likely to evoke a doctor, pharmacist, or engineer. They were a model minority, for a time. What changed? In that regard, the sheer number of people from India had suddenly increased, and now many of them are students, meaning younger people who didn't already have established careers, hence their presence in low-skill positions like retail or driving delivery.

Meanwhile, earlier this year, there was also disagreement on the American right about that country's immigration policies, specifically regarding a classification called the H-1B visa. This triggered a flare-up of anti-Indian racism of a different sort, where Indian workers are seen as competitors to the American tech sector, coming in and undercutting people who want to work as software devs and the like. If you browsed social media around this time, you could hardly avoid white people talking about how much they hated Indians, talking about curry and tech support, mocking stereotypes about poor English skills and Indians being bad at flirting.

It became even more generalized on the internet, where there's no specific person who's the target, but Indians or India in the abstract. The amount of vitriol being directed at what are effectively random, innocent people has only made me more curious to expand my knowledge and understanding of Indian society and the lives of the people who have been coming to our countries.

To begin with, it's sort of crazy that we stereotype or generalize Indians at all, considering India is an enormous place and is incredibly internally diverse. Its population is about twice that of Europe, and over four times that of the United States. Its total land area is smaller, so they have greater population density, but their land is still larger than people seem to realize: it stretches from London to Moscow, from Oslo to Athens. It's taller than the United States north to south, and driving across it would be like driving from New York to Los Vegas. If we included Pakistan, which used to be part of India, it would be even larger. To think of everybody from India altogether as a singular group would be like meeting a few people from Spain and using them as your model for understanding all of the Europe.

Indians don't even have a common language. The country technically has hundreds of languages, though only a dozen or so have speakers that number more than one percent of the population of the country. Still, there is no single Indian language much less an Indian accent. They all sound very different from each other. The most popular language, Hindi, is only spoken by about a quarter of the population. This map only shows the most popular language in each region.

India is also very religiously diverse, both in number of religions and how different they are from one another. America was historically known for its religious diversity compared with any European country, but all of its different religious views were just flavours of Christianity. India has been the birthplace of four major world religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism), and Indian society was significantly impacted by Islam after Muslims came to the region in the 13th century. For hundreds of years, India was a land of religious pluralism. Muslims, Hindus, and other groups worked alongside one another in government, and the emperor patronized multiple religions.

And today, even after the Muslim regions split off into Pakistan to the west and Bangladesh to the east, India itself still has over 200 million Muslims, making it one of the top countries in the world by Muslim population---and that's only 15 percent of their 1.4 billion people. Sikhism, whose followers are known for their beards and turbans, is followed by only around one percent of the country's population, but they're very well-represented in the West because they emigrate at such high rates. In Canada, roughly a third of our immigrants from India have been Sikhs. (I talk more about these religious groups later.)

## Indian history

. Not going back to the Bronze Age, but where the pre-British society (the Mughal Empire) came from.

In 1206, the Delhi Sultanate was established by Muslim conquerors in northern India. This meant the territory ruled by the sultan from his seat in their capital of Delhi. The naming format is similar to 'the Roman Empire', meaning the territory ruled by the emperor from his seat in the city of Rome. This state grew and shank over the years until, while on the decline, the city of Delhi was conquered by **Babur** in 1526, which is considered the beginning of the Mughal Empire. The state Babur started would eventually consume nearly the whole Indian subcontinent, and for a time was the wealthiest power on Earth. The empire was referred to by its own people as **Hindustan**, or they spoke of 'the Sultanate' thereof; there was nothing officially called 'India', nor would there be for hundreds of years. They also never referred to theirselves as the Mughal Empire. The term 'Mughal' comes from the Persian for Mongol, as Babur was a descendant of Genghis Khan. At the time this would've been a respectful nod to their ancestry.

The name India comes from the Indus river, which starts in western China and runs west, then southwest through modern Pakistan, into the Arabian sea. We now associate this with the Indus Valley Civilization, there in 3300 to 1300 years before Christ. For Europeans, the term shifted to a noun referring to that region and everything southeast of it (i.e. the opposite direction from Europe). The general Indian subcontinent was referred to as 'India Major'. Before the 15th century, Europeans had some concept of India because they could purchase goods that originated there from Arab traders, but they didn't know where exactly it was or what it looked like. To them, 'India' just meant a place in the far east that produced fabric, spices, and gemstones. This is why the countries and islands of Southeast Asia came to be known as the East Indies, because they were all grouped in as part of that same general civilization. It practically included anything south of China. (The West Indies were so called because when Europeans first landed there, they believed they were on uncharted islands east of Japan that would eventually meet up with the East Indies if they kept going west, sort of like one big archipelago.)

The Mughal Emperor **Akbar** (r. 1556--1605) has a name you may recognize from the phrase *Allahu akbar*, Arabic for 'god is great', because Akbar wasn't his birth name, but a title that literally meant *the great*. This is like how we most know the first Roman emperor as 'Augustus', which was not his birth name, but a title given to him later in life meaning *the great* or perhaps *the majestic*. (In some English texts, Akbar is referred to as Akbar the Great, even though Akbar already means that.) It was near the end of Akbar's reign that British traders first landed in India, and the prospect of trade in the east led to Elizabeth I signing a royal charter in 1600 to create the **East India Company**.

The first time a Mughal emperor met a British person was in 1609, when **Jahangir** (r. 1605--1627), son of Akbar, agreed to meet British merchants at his court. The British came not as conquerors, but as traders. Nor could they have conquered anything if they wanted to. Britain was smaller, less wealthy, less powerful, and these traders far from home, in the domain of powerful, wealthy Asian empires. They offered gifts and sought permission from Jahangir to build a trading outpost on his land, which was given. This was a period of great peace, prosperity, and development in India. They led the world in manufacturing and industry. It was in this period that a lot of great Mughal architecture was built, such as the Taj Mahal, built in the mid 17th century on the order of Shah Jahan (r. 1628--1658).

After the death of **Aurangzeb** (r. 1658--1707), India started going through its own 'fall of Rome' (the unravelling and fracturing of Mughal authority), which created the opportunity for new alliances to appear. It had been over a century since the British began operating in the region, and French traders had permanent settlements as well. In the decades that followed, many Indian princes and governors would choose to ally with British and French officers rather than with other Indian states. By this point Europeans had been there for generations---there was not a clear nativist divide by which Europeans were 'foreigners', nor a strong and unified 'Indian' identity among the rest of the subcontinent to exclude them from. Things were more local and personal. The East India Company gradually expanded its influence. The British government passed the *Government of India Act 1833*, extending the Company's charter for another twenty years, but also restructuring it to act more as an administrative entity than a commercial enterprise. Then, following discontent with the Company's rule (Indian Rebellion of 1857), Britain passed the *Government of India Act 1858*, officially abolishing the Company entirely, transferring all control to the Crown, and officially designating India part of the British Empire.

It is truly unjust that we should now forget India's great history, and the heights to which it climbed, to look down on them as though a lesser civilization or lesser people, when, at first contact, we were the ones humbling approaching them, and we've only taken advantage of the opportunity made by their downfall. In matters of thought and technology, Europe did eclipse the rest of the world after the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, but this is no fault of anybody else, and we should not assume that other peoples could never made similar advancements eventually. Even somebody with a harsh view of other cultures, that feels disdain toward a tribal society that is well adapted to its environment but which never had the accumulation of wealth for tall buildings or electricity, should find things to respect about Indian society.

Europe, and Britain especially, was significantly affected by this imperial relationship with India. Now its rulers, the British continued purchasing Indian goods---textiles, dyes, tea (before the British were associated with tea, coffee was the drink of choice, but a changing world economic landscape that made coffee more expensive followed by Indian tea being in plentiful supply got most of the country to change over, and Britons have been portrayed as tea-drinkers ever since)---and there was a mutual interest in each other's culture. Indian writers and artists travelled to England and vice versa. The British Raj became a laboratory for European governance. There are things normal to us now---like our public school systems, or the very notion of a public cemetery---that originate among British governors in India. During this time, words from numerous Indian languages also became English loanwords, some of which you probably wouldn't have guessed: mantra, guru, avatar, and karma (those all have a sort of Indian feel), but also khaki, bungalow, cot (a portable bed), bandana, pundit, punch (as in fruit punch), thug (from the *thuggee*, the name of robber-gangs who attacked travellers), loot (as in to steal), tank (as in tank of water, and later military tanks), and shampoo.

There was chauvinism on the part of many Britons, who viewed their culture as better than the culture of India. The more progressive Whigs in Britain were at times most guilty of this, viewing their Enlightenment thinking as something that put them ahead of the rest of the world. Thomas Macaulay, a British politician who played a major role in India's education policy, infamously wrote that a single bookshelf of a European library was worth more than all literature in India, and Asia, and Arabia, put together. This feeling of enlightened superiority was used partly to *justify* British rule. "Why is Britain ruling over this other country?" is a question the public would want some answer to, and Britain had, at this time, a self-image of being an enlightened country that would deliver good governance, along with the saving faith of Christianity. To fulfil this narrative, they had to think India would be terribly mismanaged without them, and one of the ways they did this was by outlawing certain types of barbarism---most memorably, sati.

Sati is an ancient concept: when a married man died, we throw his body on a funeral pyre, and then we throw his wife on there too, burning her alive. Why in the world would any culture do something like this? It sounds obviously antithetical to any sort of community. Perhaps it was only in special circumstances as some kind of ritual; perhaps it was voluntary but women had few other options after her husband was gone, and to give up and die with him was heralded as a form of honourable suicide, but then people venerated it culturally? Perhaps it wasn't even really a thing, and people just mistranslated old texts that had something to do with widows and funeral pyres. There's debate to what extent sati happened, in what circumstances, and for what reason---but at the time Britain 'banned' it, no European had ever witnessed sati happening. It was something they heard rumours of, and then proudly declared they were going to restrict going forward. This was presented to the British public as an example of the moral deficit of the Indian population and a moral victory by the British, a demonstration of our superiority. And the legacy of this propaganda---the *idea* that Indians were burning women alive before the good British came and put a stop to it---has lived on in people's minds to this day, hundreds of years later.

In the intervening period, religious tension in India grew, largely as a result of British policy meant to pit them against each other. Divide and conquer: everywhere that Britain ruled, they identified the groups within the population, granted privileges to one over the other, and navigated the resulting conflicts to their advantage. Instead of uniting against the British, it would be preferable if Muslims viewed Hindus as the main threat to their interests and cozied up with the British government against the Hindu majority. This attitude and approach to governance being pervasive in the country for so long contributed to a religious and political divide that lingers to this day, in sad contrast with India's history prior to British rule.

$As time went by, and the world economic system changed to be one largely of free trade between nations, Britain was one of many countries that found the benefit of maintaining large empires was dwindling, while the cost of keeping colonies under your thumb was only getting higher. Around the world, people were getting wealthier, more educated, growing discontent with being ruled from afar, and more interested in local autonomy. Even if opposition to colonial rule *could* be stopped---and in the beginning, it was---eventually it may end up being so expensive to continually do so that it's just not worth it anymore. By the 1900s, Britain was at peace with the reality that their empire was not going to last forever, and they shifted to building diplomatic ties and developing what we now know as the Commonwealth. It was also this century that Canada would gain full independence, likewise without any great fight by England.

The movement for independence was led by Mohandas Gandhi, whose strategy of nonviolent resistance the British were unable to put down without sacrificing all semblance of moral legitimacy. This impacted how we in the West see protest and political change. Gandhi was admired for his efforts and methods in Britain, America, and elsewhere. He was directly cited as an influence on the US civil rights movement decades later. However, his spiritual influence on the direction of the nation notwithstanding, Gandhi was never directly involved in politics. He had no impact on law, government, or India's foreign relations. To understand that side of things, look to **Jawaharlal Nehru**, an Indian man who studied law in England, attended Cambridge, and travelled across Europe before returning to India and becoming involved in politics in the 1920s. He later served as India's first Prime Minister after independence in 1947, a position he held until his death in 1964. Nehru, more than anybody else, moulded India as the country we know today.

When India was in the process of becoming independent, it also underwent partition. The Muslim population of India, led by **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**, believed that after the British left, the Muslim population would be marginalized in a Hindu-majority India, and that for their own sake, the Muslims ought to declare independence, creating Pakistan. Jinnah died in 1948, only a year after his vision became reality, and he is now revered in Pakistan as father of the nation. There were calls in India to pursue a similar path and become an explicitly religious country, a Hindustan. Nehru rejected this. Though he was from a Hindu family, Nehru was not a religious man, and he believed that India was home to many different peoples and religions, including Muslims. Despite their new neighbours declaring their countries Islamic states, Nehru stood as a defender of secularism, humanism, and religious pluralism.

Nehru and his party were socialists, but they deliberately avoided aligning too strongly with either side during the Cold War, which is probably why many in the West don't associate India with socialism, despite this being one of the express goals of their government for decades. Nehru didn't full agree with the Marxist approach that had taken over Russia and China. What he did believe in was national independence, and democracy. Whereas Communist parties came to power by coup and were governed as one-party states, Nehru was always freely and fairly elected, and instead of taking the excuse that India wasn't ready for democracy---because most of its population was illiterate, living in rural areas with no knowledge of politics---they sought to change their conditions, massively improving their literacy rate and organizing groups to go across the country, village by village, educating people about government, elections, and providing information about political parties and candidates. This undertaking is not as widely known of and celebrated as it should be, and it's the reason that today India can boast being the world's largest democracy.

There was conflict about what India's official language for business and politics should be after independence. At first they tried to make it Hindi, the most popular language and the language spoken in the capital, but this led to violent conflict. It was seen as too much favouring the Hindi-speaking population. As a compromise, they settled on English also being an option, so they could learn that instead of Hindi. This compromise is still in place---the Indian House of Commons (called the Lok Sabha) is conducted in a combination of Hindi and English.

The next big leader of India after Nehru was his daughter, Indira Gandhi (of no relation to Mahatma Gandhi), who first became Prime Minister in 1966. Now largely associated with Margaret Thatcher, the "Iron Lady" was first a term applied to Indira. It was around the beginning of her tenure that India went through a Green revolution, as high-yield variety seeds and mechanized farming equipment massively increased agricultural output, changing the country's economic landscape. India was trying to balance economic interests with their goal of sovereignty and self-sufficiency, which a modernizing economy appeared to threaten. The world economy was transitioning alongside the neoliberal ideas of the 1970s and 80s; foreign companies were becoming interested in Indian agriculture, and control of land and capital began accumulating, to the detriment of the small farmer---but this was still limited at the time, as India had been very protectionist for decades.

Indira's rule was cut short when she was assassinated in 1984. There were separatists wanted by the Indian government who hid out in the golden temple, believing it would be off-limits due to its cultural significance, being a holy site to the Sikh religion---but Indira Gandhi signed the order to have the army attack it to apprehend them. This was called Operation Blue Star. Indian forces also attacked various other Sikh temples across the region. It turned out the Sikhs were armed and fought back, and it spiralled into a much worse conflict than anticipated, and the attack gravely offended Sikhs everywhere---including two Sikh men who worked as bodyguards for Indira, who shot her in retaliation for the attack. They were both caught and swiftly executed.

$In the years after Indira Gandhi's death, India would significantly change course. They embraced economic liberalization more fully, started building an urban middle class, and invested in education, especially in the computer technology sector---in a way, the origin of the "Indian tech support" stereotype that Americans know today. For the most part, this change in strategy was a big success.

India's population in 1900 was about 400 million. It only exploded to over a billion in the last hundred years. At some point, the population growth outpaced infrastructure development, and as a result many Indian homes lacked toilets. This resulted in a stereotype about Indians and public defecation---but this is also a problem in many other developing countries, in impoverished regions in southern Asia, China, Africa, South America, and even in some American cities. What do you think everybody here would resort to if all of our plumbing suddenly disappeared? India only gets this special attention and ridicule because certain people hated Indians anyway and in this observation found an insult that sticks.

In recent years, India overtook China to be the world's most populous country. And unlike China, it hasn't closed itself off from the rest of the world's internet. As their population becomes more internet-connected, your internet experience will become affected by the presence of Indian users---in a way it's *not* affected by the presence of Chinese users, who are hidden away on their own websites, can't access any of ours, and are far less likely to speak English. For humanity, this is a great thing. The ability to be so directly connected with people on the other side of the world is an incredible privilege that all generations before us could only dream of. And for world politics, the fact India has not gone fully down the path of China continues to be a great relief. India has some important similarities with China---most obviously, being a developing economy with an extremely large population---but is less antagonistic, more open to working with us, and way more comfortable with Western notions of freedom and democracy. It's possible for us to make conflict with them and push them away, but our goal should be the opposite. We should very much desire to be friends with this country if we can.

There are many Indians today who are aware of the bad impressions and poor reputation some of their people have been giving their country internationally. They're self-aware of their own problems. They're embarrassed by some of their own countrymen and they want to be better. Even if you've personally had some negative experiences with a few Indian immigrants, remember that you're talking about a population four times the size of America. Surely I wouldn't say I hate Americans based only on having a bad experience with one, two, or even a dozen of them. There are many different types of Americans, different regions within America, different subcultures, different religions, different politics, different personalities, different ways of seeing the world. But we have an easier time understanding this, and perceiving the complexities of a thing we're familiar with, instead of one we're not.

    ## A bit more info about religions

    Though India is home to many Muslims, you're as likely to encounter Muslims from elsewhere in the world. The two religions that we most associate with India specifically are Hinduism and Sikhism.

    **Sikhism** was founded in the late 1400s, based around the teachings of a line of 10 gurus that carried on until the early 1700s. This is the origin of the word 'guru' in English. Today, Sikh teachings are represented by their holy text, the *Guru Granth Sahib*. In the early days, Sikhs endured persecution for refusing to convert to other religions. Their faith, unlike others in the region, rejected the caste system, and promoted gender equality. Sikhs today are known for their beards and turbans, which are considered holy in the Sikh religion. They believe in something called the five Ks: their hair, a wooden comb, an iron bracelet, special underwear, and a ceremonial dagger. They believe in totally embracing the body that god has given them, which is why they don't remove any hair; but they also think you should keep that body orderly through regular grooming, which is why they have the comb. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion, and though they accept converts, they don't proselytize. A Sikh place of worship is called a Gurdwara, meaning a place of the guru, and they're often known for their tradition of Langar (lun-ger), providing free vegetarian meals to all people, regardless of their faith, caste, gender, or any other personal trait or status in society. The Sikh tradition is very egalitarian, and promotes a sense of duty in service to others, called Sevā.

    Sikhism is a minority in India. There are tens of millions of Sikhs, but India's population is so vast that this amounts to only 1.5 percent of the country. For being such a small subset of their population, we're especially aware of them in the West, partly because of how many Sikhs have come as immigrants to our countries. In Canada, around one third of immigrants from India have been Sikhs. The other reason is that Sikhs have been part of noteworthy political disputes with the Indian government, including Operation Blue Star and the assassination of Indira Gandhi. The Sikh population is most concentrated in a the northwestern Indian region called Punjab, a plateau that's now split between India and Pakistan. There is a Sikh nationalist movement that aims to achieve political independence for this region, as the only place in the world where Sikhs are the majority. They refer to the proposed region as Khalistan, derived from *Khalsa*, which refers to followers of Sikhism who have been properly initiated. In 2023, the Indian government [had a man in Canada named Hardeep Singh Nijjar killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeep_Singh_Nijjar) because he was a Sikh leader who supported the Khalistan movement, which the present-day Indian government strongly opposes.

    **Hinduism** is a much larger and more complex religion. It's less centralized, has no specific founder, has multiple deities that are worshipped, and has many different sacred texts written in different time periods. The term 'Hinduism' was originally an exonym that came from a word for the general region, so it's a bit like if the various beliefs of pre-Christian Europe were blended together and then formalized as a religion called 'Europism'. Though to speak of Hinduism is proper today, prior to the British colonial period people would've just said they're followers of a specific deity or perhaps of the Sanātana Dharma, meaing the eternal way. Today Hinduism has over a billion followers, making it the third largest religion in the world after Christianity and Islam. It began during what's now called the Vedic period, between 1500 and 500 BC, when tribes were first migrating into the Indian subcontinent, and when the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts, were first written, though their content is largely hymns, chants, rituals, and meditation, and the exact time they were written is fuzzy. Then, centuries later (800--200 BC) came texts called the Upanishads, which established the foundation of Hindu philosophy, introducing concepts you've probably heard of.

    Hindus believe there is one, ultimate reality, called Brahman, which takes on many forms, and that every soul is just one part of this divine reality, cycling through it via rebirth or reïncarnation, as influenced by one's karma, meaning the moral sum of your actions. The goal of Hindu philosophy is to break free from that cycle by achieving moksha, meaning liberation, which you do through self-realization and devotion to the gods. They worship various gods, the most well known of which are the triple deity of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer, the personifications of the cosmic forces of creation, preservation, and destruction, together called the Trimurti. Lakshmi, a goddess with four arms, is Vishnu's wife, and the gods Krishna and Rama, whose names you may recognize, are actually reïncarnations of Vishnu. It feels a lot like reading about ancient Greek and Roman mythology.

    Hindu festivals are numerous and colourful. The most popular is called Diwali, the festival of lights, which symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. Most Hindus are vegetarian, and cows are indeed revered as a sacred animal, admired for their gentleness and featured in much of their artwork. There was even a conflict in Indian history. Hindus, like Jainists and Buddhists, sometimes wear a red dot on their forehead, called a bindi, coming from the Sanskrit for a dot. This isn't always a religious practice; it can also be done for purely cultural reasons, associated with southern Asia. For Hindus, it may represent your ajna, or your third eye chakra, a spot on your head which symbolizes your unconscious mind, and represents a link to your intuition, wisdom, or some kind other sort of inner self-awareness. Traditionally, Hindu women began wearing a red dot to indicate they were married. However, there's no guarantee that somebody is married if you see they have a red bindi, because not everybody follows tradition exactly. It depends on how traditional the person in question is.
