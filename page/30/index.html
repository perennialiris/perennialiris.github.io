# India

. 2024-03-05

Earlier this year, there was a disagreement on the American right about the H-1B visa program, which triggered a flare-up of anti-Indian racism. They're apparently competitors in the American tech sector, meaning 20-something white guys who want to be coders are primed to hate on them. If you browsed social media at that time, you could hardly avoid white people talking about how much they hated Indians, talking about curry, poor English skills, tech support, and making fun of Indian stereotypes about being bad at sex and flirting, or in some cases going on deranged rants about how Indians are actually mentally inferior and comparing them to ants.

Up here in Canada, there's also been a lot of racism directed at Indians because they're one of the main immigrant groups that our country has received in recent years as general labour, so anybody who wants to cast their anti-immigration feelings into racism picks them as their main target. It's been increasingly uncomfortable. And in Canada, instead of it being tech-specific, they're cast as being the kind of people who work low-end jobs, which crowds out young people trying to enter the labour market. That association is a reversal from decades ago, when it was more likely that mention of an Indian immigrant evoked a pharmacist or engineer. They were a model minority. What changed? The number of them coming over suddenly ramped up, and most of them were no longer high-skill labour anymore.

What I find noteworthy about anti-Indian racism is how it doesn't seem to be rooted in fear of Indians. That's the case when it comes to a lot of racism directed against black people, Hispanic people, and Arabs, where there's fearmongering about their being aggressive criminals, coming here to sell cocaine and start street gangs and wage jihad. When it comes to Indians, their main stereotype is being the people who answer the phone when your internet is out, or being the people who drive food delivery to your house. So what is the basis for this hatred? It's purely looking down on them, treating them like dirt because you think they're below you. In some sense, this makes it even worse than racism against other groups.

To me it seems like people don't actually learn that racism is bad so much as they learn to stop being racist toward a specific group of people. They're racist against, say, black people, until they meet some black people and humanize them and realize how stupid it was to hold such harsh prejudice against individuals against their perception of some group average, and then probably soften their attitudes about those averages too. But then a Chinese person comes along, and it starts all over, until they go through the process of learning that racism against Chinese people isn't good either. They don't transfer the lesson between groups.

In a sense, it's crazy that we sterotype or generalize Indians at all, because India is an enormous place and incredibly diverse. Its population is about twice that of Europe, and over four times that of the United States. Its total land area is smaller, as its population is more dense, but it's still larger than people seem to realize: it stretches from London to Moscow, from Oslo to Athens. To even think of everybody from India together would be like meeting somebody from Ireland, interpreting that simply as 'Europe', and relating it to corruption in Poland, crime in Romania, or telling them about a time you went to Spain.

They don't even all speak the same language. India technically has hundreds, though only a dozen or so have speakers that number more than one percent of the population. Still, there is no singular Indian language much less an Indian accent. The most popular language, Hindi, is only spoken by about a quarter of the population.

India also has substantial religious diversity, not only in number of religions, but in how different these religions are from each other (unlike in America---which was historically noted for having more religious diversity than European countries, but all of its religious views were just different flavours of Christianity). It was the birthplace of four major world religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism), and their society has been significantly influenced by Islam after Muslims came to the region from the Middle East in the 13th century. For hundreds of years, India was a land of religious pluralism. Muslims, Hindus, and other groups worked alongside one another in government, and the emperor patronized multiple religions. Today, even after the Muslim regions split off into Pakistan to the west and Bangladesh to the east, India itself still has over 200 million Muslims, making it one of the top countries in the world by Muslim population---and that's only 15 percent of their 1.4 billion people.

In 1206, the Delhi Sultanate was established by Muslim conquerors in northern India. This meant the territory ruled by the sultan from his seat in their capital of Delhi. The naming format is similar to 'the Roman Empire', meaning the territory ruled by the emperor from his seat in the city of Rome. This state grew and shrank over a few centuries until eventually the city of Delhi was conquered by **Babur** in 1526, which is considered the beginning of the Mughal Empire. The state Babur started would eventually consume nearly the whole Indian subcontinent, and for a time was the wealthiest place on the planet. The empire was referred to by its own people as **Hindustan**, or they spoke of 'the Sultanate' thereof; there was nothing officially called 'India' until the formation of the modern Indian republic in 1947, and they never referred to theirselves as the Mughal Empire. The term 'Mughal' comes from the Persian for Mongol, as Babur was a descendant of Genghis Khan. At the time this would've been a respectful nod to their ancestry.

The name India comes from the Indus river, which starts in western China and runs west, then southwest through modern Pakistan, into the Arabian sea. We now associate this with the Indus Valley Civilization, there in 3300 to 1300 years before Christ. For Europeans, the term shifted to a noun referring to that region and everything southeast of it (i.e. the opposite direction from Europe). The general Indian subcontinent was referred to as 'India Major'. Before the 15th century, Europeans had some concept of India because they could purchase goods that originated there from Arab traders, but they didn't know where exactly it was or what it looked like. To them, 'India' just meant a place in the far east that produced fabric, spices, and gemstones. This is why the countries and islands of Southeast Asia came to be known as the East Indies, because they were all grouped in as part of that same general civilization. It practically included anything south of China. (The West Indies were so called because when Europeans first landed there, they believed they were on uncharted islands east of Japan that would eventually meet up with the East Indies if they kept going west, sort of like one big archipelago.)

The Mughal Emperor **Akbar** (r. 1556--1605) has a name you may recognize from the phrase *Allahu akbar*, Arabic for 'god is great', because Akbar wasn't his birth name, but a title that literally meant *the great*. This is like how we most know the first Roman emperor as 'Augustus', which was not his birth name, but a title given to him later in life meaning *the great* or perhaps *the majestic*. (In some English texts, Akbar is referred to as Akbar the Great, even though Akbar already means that.) It was near the end of Akbar's reign that British traders first landed in India, and the prospect of trade in the east led to Elizabeth I signing a royal charter in 1600 to create the **East India Company**.

The first time a Mughal emperor met a British person was in 1609, when **Jahangir** (r. 1605--1627), son of Akbar, agreed to meet British merchants at his court. The British came now as conquerors, but as traders. Nor could they have conquered anything if they wanted to. Britain was smaller, less wealthy, less powerful, and far from home, in the domain of powerful, wealthy Asian empires. They offered gifts and sought permission from Jahangir to build a trading outpost on his land, which was given. This was a period of great peace, prosperity, and development in India. They led the world in manufacturing and industry. It was in this period that a lot of great Mughal architecture was built, such as the Taj Mahal, built in the mid 17th century on the order of Shah Jahan (r. 1628--1658).

After the death of **Aurangzeb** (r. 1658--1707), India started going through its own 'fall of Rome' (the unravelling and fracturing of Mughal authority), which created the opportunity for new alliances to appear. It had been over a century since the British began operating in the region, and French traders had permanent settlements as well. In the decades that followed many Indian princes and governors would choose to ally with British and French officers rather than with other Indian states. By this point Europeans had been there for generations---there was not a clear nativist divide by which Europeans were 'foreigners', nor a strong and unified 'Indian' identity among the rest of the subcontinent to exclude them from. Things were more local and personal. The East India Company gradually expanded its influence. The British government passed the *Government of India Act 1833*, extending the Company's charter for another twenty years, but also restructuring it to act more as an administrative entity than a commercial enterprise. Then, following discontent with the Company's rule (Indian Rebellion of 1857), Britain passed the *Government of India Act 1858*, officially abolishing the Company entirely, transferring all control to the Crown, and officially designating India part of the British Empire.

Europe, and Britian especially, was significantly affected by this imperial relationship with India. Now its rulers, the British continued purchasing Indian goods---textiles, dyes, tea (before the British were associated with tea, coffee was the drink of choice, but a changing world economic landscape that made coffee more expensive followed by Indian tea being in plentiful supply got most of the country to change over, and Britons have been portrays as tea-drinkers ever since)---and there was a mutual interest in each other's culture. Indian writers and artists travelled to England and vice versa. The British Raj became a laboratory for European governance. There are things normal to us now---like our public school systems, or the very notion of a public cemetery---that originate among British governors in India. During this time, words from numerous Indian languages also became English loanwords, some of which you probably wouldn't have guessed: mantra, guru, avatar, and karma (those all have a sort of Indian feel), but also khaki, bungalow, cot (a portable bed), bandana, pundit, punch (as in fruit punch), thug (from the *thuggee*, the name of robber-gangs who attacked travellers), loot (as in to steal), tank (as in tank of water, and later military tanks), and shampoo.

There was chauvinism on the part of many Britons, who viewed their culture as better than the culture of India. The more progressive Whigs in Britain were at times most guilty of this, viewing their Enlightenment thinking as something that put them ahead of the rest of the world. Thomas Macaulay, a British politician who played a major role in India's education policy, infamously wrote that a single bookshelf of a European library was worth more than all literature in India, and Asia, and Arabia, put together. This feeling of enlightened superiority was used partly to *justify* British rule. "Why is Britain ruling over this other country?" is a question the public would want some answer to, and Britain had, at this time, a self-image of being an enlightened country that would deliver good governance, along with the saving faith of Christianity. To fulfil this narrative, they had to think India would be terribly mismanaged without them, and one of the ways they did this was by outlawing certain types of barbarism---most memorably, sati.

Sati is an ancient concept: when a married man died, we throw his body on a funeral pyre, and then we throw his wife on there too, burning her alive. Why in the world would any culture do something like this? It sounds obviously antithetical to any sort of community. Perhaps it was only in special circumstances as some kind of ritual; perhaps it was voluntary but women had few other options after her husband was gone, and to give up and die with him was heralded as a form of honorable suicide, but then people venerated it culturally? Perhaps it wasn't even really a thing, and people just mistranslated old texts that had something to do with widows and funeral pyres. There's debate to what extent sati happened, in what circumstances, and for what reason---but at the time Britain 'banned' it, no European had ever witnessed sati happening. It was something they heard rumours of, and then proudly declared they were going to restrict going forward. This was presented to the British public as an example of the moral defecit of the Indian population and a moral victory by the British, a demonstration of our superiority. And the legacy of this propaganda---the *idea* that Indians were burning women alive before the good British came and put a stop to it---has lived on in people's minds to this day, hundreds of years later.

In the intervening period, religious tension in India grew, largely as a result of British policy meant to pit them against each other. Divide and conquer---everywhere that Britain ruled, they identified the groups within the population, granted privileges to one over the other, and navigated the resulting conflicts to their advantage. Instead of uniting against the British, it would be preferable if Muslims viewed Hindus as the main threat to their interests and cozied up with the British government against the Hindu majority. This attitude and approach to governance being pervasive in the country for so long contributed to a religious and political divide that lingers to this day, in sad contrast with India's history prior to British rule.

$As time went by, and the world economic system changed to be one largely of free trade between nations, Britain was one of many countries that found the benefit of maintaining large empires was dwindling, while the cost of keeping colonies under your thumb was only getting higher. Around the world, people were getting wealthier, more educated, growing discontent with being ruled from afar, and more interested in local autonomy. Even if opposition to colonial rule *could* be stopped---and in the beginning, it was---eventually it may end up being so expensive to continually do so that it's just not worth it anymore. By the 1900s, Britain was at peace with the reality that their empire was not going to last forever, and they shifted to building diplomatic ties and developing what we now know as the Commonwealth. It was also this century that Canada would gain full independence, likewise without any great fight by England.

The movement for independence being led by Mahatma Gandhi, whose strategy of nonviolent resistance the British were unable to put down without sacrificing any semblance of moral high ground, impacted how we in the West see protest and political change. Gandhi was admired for his efforts and methods in Britain, America, and elsewhere. He was directly cited as an influence on the US civil rights movement decades later. However, his spiritual influence on the direction of the nation notwithstanding, Gandhi was never directly involved in politics. He had no impact on law, government, or India's foreign relations.

To understand that side of things, look to **Jawaharlal Nehru**, an Indian man who studied law in England, attended Cambridge, and travelled across Europe before returning to India and becoming involved in politics in the 1920s. He later served as India's first Prime Minister after independence in 1947, a position he held until his death in 1964. Nehru, more than anybody else, molded India as the country we know today.

When India was in the process of becoming independent, it also underwent partition. The Muslim population of India, led by **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**, believed that after the British left, the Muslim population would be marginalized in a Hindu-majority India, and that for their own sake, the Muslims ought to declare independence, creating Pakistan. Jinnah died in 1948, only a year after his vision became reality, and he is now revered in Pakistan as father of the nation. There were calls in India to pursue a similar path and become an explicitly religious country, a Hindustan. Nehru rejected this. Though he was from a Hindu family, Nehru was not a religious man, and he believed that India was home to many different peoples and religions, including Muslims. Despite their new neighbours declaring their countries Islamic states, Nehru stood as a defender of secularism, religious pluralism, and humanism.

Nehru and his party were socialists, but they deliberately avoided aligning too strongly with either side during the Cold War, which is probably why many in the West don't associate India with socialism, despite this being one of the express goals of their government for decades. Nehru didn't full agree with the Marxist approach that had taken over Russia and China. What he did believe in was national independence, and democracy. Whereas Communist parties came to power by coup and were governed as one-party states, Nehru was always freely and fairly elected, and instead of taking the excuse that India wasn't ready for democracy---because most of its population was illiterate, living in rural areas with no knowledge of politics---they sought to change their conditions, massively improving their literacy rate and organizing groups to go across the country, village by village, educating people about government, elections, and providing information about political parties and candidates. This undertaking is not as widely known of and celebrated as it should be, and it's the reason that today India can boast being the world's largest democracy.

There was conflict about what India's official language for business and politics should be after independence. At first they tried to make it Hindi, the most popular language and the language spoken in the capital, but this led to violent conflict. It was seen as too much favouring the Hindi-speaking population. As a compromise, they settled on English also being an option, so they could learn that instead of Hindi. This compromise is still in place---the Indian House of Commons (called the Lok Sabha) is conducted in a combination of Hindi and English.

The next big leader of India after Nehru was his daughter, Indira Gandhi (of no relation to Mahatma Gandhi), who first became Prime Minister in 1966. Now largely associated with Margaret Thatcher, the "Iron Lady" was first a term applied to Indira. It was around the beginning of her tenure that India went through a Green revolution, as high-yield variety seeds and mechanized farming equipment massively increased agricultural output, changing the country's economic landscape. India was trying to balance economic interests with their goal of sovereignty and self-sufficiency, which a modernizing economy appeared to threaten. The world economy was transitioning into the neoliberal ideas of the 1970s, foreign companies became interested in Indian agriculture, and control of land and capital began accumulating to the detriment of the small farmer---but this was still limited at the time, as India had been very protectionist for decades.

Indira's rule was cut short when she was assassinated in 1984 by Sikh men who had been working as her bodyguards. **Sikhism** is a minority religion in India, commonly known for their turbans and beards, which are considered holy in the Sikh religion. They make up around 1 and a half percent of India's population---though for perspective, that's still tens of millions of people, larger than Romania, Chile, or the Netherlands. Often overlooked for being far smaller than the Hindu or Muslim populations, the Sikh population is most concentrated a the northern Indian region called the Punjab. There is a Sikh nationalist movement which calls for this region, the only place in the world where Sikhs are the majority, to be given political independence in the same way that Pakistan was. They refer to this proposed region as Khalistan, derived from *Khalsa*, which refers to followers of Sikhism who have been properly initiated (like if there were a noun for Christians who have been baptized). This is noteworthy because the Khalistan movement has been relevant to modern politics in the West recently. In 2023, the Indian government [had a man in Canada named Hardeep Singh Nijjar killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeep_Singh_Nijjar) because he was a Sikh leader who supported the Khalistan movement, which the present-day Indian government strongly opposes.

The Sikh religion has a holy site called the golden temple, which is indeed covered in real gold leaf. There were some separatists wanted by the Indian government, and they hid out in this temple thinking it would be off-limits---but Indira Gandhi signed the order to have the army attack it to apprehend them, despite the religious significance of the location. This was called Operation Blue Star. They also attacked various other Sikh temples across the region. It turns out the Sikhs at the golden temple were armed and fought back, and it spiralled into a much worse conflict than they anticipated, and the attack gravely offended Sikhs everywhere---including two who worked as bodyguards for Indira, who shot her in retaliation for the attack. They were both caught and swiftly executed.

$In the years after Indira Gandhi's death, India would significantly change course. They embraced economic liberalization more fully, started building an urban middle class, and invested in education, especially in the computer technology sector---in a way, the origin of the "Indian tech support" stereotype that Americans know today. For the most part, this change in strategy was a big success.

India's population in 1900 was about 400 million. It only exploded to over a billion in the last hundred years. At some point, the population growth outpaced infrastructure development, and as a result many Indian homes lacked toilets. This resulted in a stereotype about Indians and public defecation---but this is also a problem in many other developing countries, in impoverished regions in southern Asia, China, Africa, South America, and even in some American cities. What do you think everybody here would resort to if all of our plumbing suddenly disappeared? India only gets this special attention and ridicule because certain people hated Indians anyway and in this observation found an insult that sticks.

In recent years, India overtook China to be the world's most populous country. And unlike China, it hasn't closed itself off from the rest of the world's internet. As their population becomes more internet-connected, your internet experience will become affected by the presence of Indian users---in a way it's *not* affected by the presence of Chinese users, who are hidden away on their own websites, can't access any of ours, and far less likely to speak English. For humanity, this is a great thing. The ability to be so directly connected with people on the other side of the world is an incredible privilege that all generations before us could only dream of. And for world politics, the fact India has not gone fully down the path of China continues to be a great relief. India has some important similarities with China---most obviously, being a developing economy with an extremely large population---but is less antagonistic, more open to working with us, and way more comfortable with Western notions of freedom and democracy. It's possible for us to make conflict with them and push them away, but our goal should be the opposite. We should very much desire to be friends with this country if we can.

There are many Indians today who are aware of the bad impressions and poor reputation some of their people have been giving their country internationally. They're self-aware of their own problems. They're embarrassed by some of their own countrymen and they want to be better. Even if you've personally had some negative experiences with a few Indian immigrants, remember that you're talking about a population four times the size of America. Surely I wouldn't say I hate Americans based onl on having a bad experience with one, two, or even a dozen of them. There are many different types of Americans, different regions within America, different subcultures, different religions, different politics, different personalities, different ways of seeing the world. But we have an easier time understanding this, and perceiving the complexities of a thing we're familiar with, instead of one we're not.

*If you're the kind of casual history nerd who's fascinated by Greco--Roman history, you might also like reading in more detail about the formation of the Mughal Empire, especially from Babur until Aurangzeb (the last great Mughal before the empire's decline). There are many themes in commons: uniting a vast land empire, layers of class conflict, struggle for power between brothers, military innovation and strategy, and grand architecture that's still around to this day.*
