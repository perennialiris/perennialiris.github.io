This is one of my favourite paintings. I've been using it and edits of it across the internet for a long time now. I don't remember where I first saw it. Interestingly, if you try and determine its identity, there are two common answers:

* **A beauty holding a bird** by Louis Emile Pinel de Grandchamp
* **L'oiseau Chéri** (French for 'lovely bird' or something) by Alexandre Cabanel

Cabanel is the more well-known artist (even if you don't recognize his name, you'd probably recognize many of his paintings). Grandchamp doesn't have a Wikipedia page, though he's mentioned in an index as a French painter who lived 1831–1894.

I reviewed many of their other works while thinking about this painting, and my conclusion is this work doesn't resemble Cabanel's in theme or style. Cabanel was more interested in classical European style and specialized in portraiture and scenes depicting European myth, whereas Grandchamp was clearly more interested in depicting slice of life and featuring foreign cultures. In fact, the Wikipedia index he's included on was "noteworthy Orientalist artists".

I also feel Cabanel is such a noteworthy painter that if this work were his, it would be easier for me to verify that with a higher degree of certainty. The fact this is a little sketchy adds plausibility to it being a painting by somebody lesser known, mistakenly attributed to somebody better known.

So I could be wrong, but in my personal files I save this as "A beauty holding a bird by Louis Emile Pinel de Grandchamp".
