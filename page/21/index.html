I've been using this painting and edits of it across the internet for a long time now. I don't remember where I first saw it, but I saved it and ended up using it in a lot of places.

I've also seen different versions of it. I don't know where they originate. Look at how different the wall behind her is. Were multiple original versions painted?

Interestingly, if you try and determine its identity, there's also two common answers:

* **A beauty holding a bird** by Louis Emile Pinel de Grandchamp (1831--1894)
* **L'oiseau Chéri** (French for 'lovely bird' or something) by Alexandre Cabanel (1823--1889)

Cabanel is the more well-known artist. Even if you don't recognize his name, you'd probably recognize many of his paintings, like *The Birth of Venus* or his *Nymph and Satyr*.

Grandchamp doesn't have a Wikipedia page, but you can find his other works on various art websites, and his name is mentioned on some index pages, like [List of Orientialist artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Orientalist_artists), meaning Western artists who did works with Arabic or Asian influence.

If you look at other paintings by Cabanel, they don't resemble this one in theme or style. Cabanel was more interested in classical European style and specialized in portraiture and European myth. Pinel de Grandchamp was clearly more interested in slice of life and featuring foreign cultures.

I also feel Cabanel is such a noteworthy painter that if this work were his, it would be easier for me to verify that with a higher degree of certainty. The fact there's even a dispute about its origin probably adds plausibility to it being a painting by somebody lesser known, but sometimes mistakenly attributed to somebody else.

So, I could be wrong, but in my personal files I save this as "A beauty holding a bird by Louis Emile Pinel de Grandchamp".
