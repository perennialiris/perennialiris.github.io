2024-08-22 | "Ukraine is the greatest threat to this nation and to the world. We should rescind all funding and financing, pull out all military support, and apologize to Russia. ... Ukraine cannot win. But by the graces of Russia does Ukraine continue. Because Russia has nukes. Russia is deciding not to flatten Ukraine. If Russia decides right now that an invasion into their territory is too much, and so they decide to just carpet bomb or nuke Ukraine, it's over. Maybe that's what NATO wants: justification for entering the war and scaling things up and starting world war three. World war three being the excuse by which they can rush into Russia, destroy their government. Putin's between a rock and a hard place. What's he going to do? Allow NATO to expand on its border? Literally invade its territory? It did."

2024-08-28 | Anya Prampil, former RT connection, guest on his show. "I went to the Trump Putin summit at the time I was working for RT, which was super fun, because we were at the centre of the conspiracy to elect Trump, you may recall. And for me it was incredible, actually, to witness a US president acting like a statesman and sitting down with a powerful leader of another powerful country and supposedly acting in good faith."

2024-05-30 | "As of today, with this fake guilty verdict against Trump, America is no longer the United States. We are a third-world shithole heading for a Civil War. I have no desire to see this country to unify. There’s no country to unite. We are long past that. F*ck these liberals and anyone who votes for them. Trump will win and we will destroy every trace of their party. We must resist any calls at unity from these Democrats if we win. No mercy. No solace. Nothing. Today, we know that they want to end our lives and end everything in this country. FUCK JOE BIDEN. FUCK ALVIN BRAGG. FUCK STORMY DANIELS. FUCK JUDGE MERCHAN.

2024-07-24 | "Finding Trump is like converting to a new religion. Once you find Trump, you wake up and realize all that you have been told before was a lie. Once you find Trump, you do not go in halfheartedly, you go all in. It’s more of a conversion of mind, body and soul than it is just a “vote”. That might sound crazy if you’re not part of it, but that really is how it is. That’s why his supporters, once in his side, cannot be moved. And that’s why this poll is bullshit."

2024-09-10 | "Kamala Harris’s entire campaign is based in hatred and fear. That’s why she repeats the Project 2025 lie over and over and over.

2024-08-12 | "I brought my dog to swim in the ocean a bit today for the first time. He’s never been swimming at the beach in his life. Before I lowered him down near the water, his little arms started paddling in the air. It got me to thinking about third-world immigrants and rape. There is a primal instinct in all animals that teach them the things they do. Much like a dog can swim without ever being taught, a third-world migrant behaves in the most primal ways by instinct. Rape, murder, criminality - these are things that are deeply embedded in the DNA of a third-world migrant. Can these things be trained away? Perhaps, for the truly intelligent ones who make an effort. But for your average one, they’ll resort to primal instincts every single time. The only true solution to third-world migration is to reduce it to ZERO and have no tolerance whatsoever for it."

I don't see Latin American nations dealing with systematic replacement. It's only historically White nations that are dealing with systematic replacement. And it's the White leaders of these historically White nations that are systematically allowing their people to be replaced. Why are we not allowed to mention that without being called racists?"

So he replaced these images, in our passport, with an image of himself, swimming as a boy at Harrington Lake, and pictures of snowflakes in honor of members of his liberal cabinet."
