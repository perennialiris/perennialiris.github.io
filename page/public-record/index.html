||th The Young Turks (Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian)
2024-11-29 | Cenk: "I've been trying to figure out why I'm more optimistic now than I was before the election, even though I was so against the guy who won. I know now. MAGA is not my mortal enemy (and neither is the extreme left). My mortal enemy is the establishment. And they have been defeated!" .. "It's not just that the establishment candidate lost, it's that their media is mortally wounded. The source of their strength was not insipid politicians like Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden. The source of their strength was their propaganda machine - the mainstream media." [src](https://x.com/cenkuygur/status/1862577177935450343) [img](media/cenk-20241129.jpg)
2025-08-24 | <section class="ie-expand">Cenk Uyghur: "That's why it's deeply ironic when they keep throwing around that 'anti-semitic' word, right? Which now means absolutely nothing. They ruined that word. It used to mean something, now it means heroic fighter for peace, because if you fight for peace, they're going to call you an anti-semite, guaranteed, guaranteed. And they're going to say it two billion times over. This is a one-tricky pony, and they're giant liars, and all they love to do is smear everyone else. They're like *'Oh, don't... Ignore our genocide---the real problem is people criticizing us. They're so evil and hateful!'* You know what? Everybody's sick of that. We're vomiting that word. We can't stand it anymore. Now when anybody uses the word 'anti-semite' they're almost definitely a racist, 'cause they're the ones yeah, Israeli children are the most precious children in the world, I think Israeli children are as precious as every child on the planet Earth, I hope none of 'em every get hurt. Alright? Now we say the same thing for, about, Palestinian children, and they're like *'No! You're an anti-semite if you don't agree that we should have murdered 20,000 of their kids! We should murder another 20,000! And if you don't say it, you hate Jews!'* No, brother, no. You hate Palestinians. You're a deeply racist, nearly psychotic person at this point."<br>Cenk Uyghur: ... "So I'm done with any Israeli supporter still defending the starvation of children. And what they've done to Jewish culture, you know, is sickening. Holocaust survivor, spoke out eloquently against it today; we're going to show that later in the show with you guys. My favourite author in the world, Yuval Harari, is an Israeli. And he said, *'they're destroying our culture'*. The culture used to be for openness and caring about the underdog and the victims, and that's absolutely true. Jewish people in this country [America] have been wonderful to me throughout my life. They were the leaders of the civil rights movements in a lot of ways, because why, they wanted to step up for other people who were abused, et cetera. Now Israel has turned that culture into an oppressor culture, a racist culture, a culture who's just indifferent to other people's pain, other people's suffering, and all they do is lie. Every word out of an Israeli government official is a lie. So no, no, the Israeli government leaders are deeply evil. And now, if you're still supporting them when the entire rest of the world says, yes, it's definitely a famine, yes, you're definitely starving their children to death, yes, you've definitely murdered 62,000 of them, it's an 83 percent civilian kill ratio, one of the worst in modern history, worse than Bosnia, worse than Sudan, worse than Aleppo and the butcher of Damascus. Assad butchered those people in Aleppo, that was a 59 percent civilian kill ratio. Hamas was a 67 percent civilian kill ratio on October 7. Israel is at an 83 percent civilian kill ratio. They're butchering civilians. And from the Jewish people, that's heartbreaking, for what they've gone through. Now Israel is inflicting on others. And I can't stand it anymore."<br>"And if you're a person of decency and any kind of moral conscience, you have to do everything in your power to get them to stop. It's like we're living in the middle of the holocaust now, and we're, the biggest debate we're having is, *'have we offended the Germans too much?'* Who cares if we offend the Germans? We should be going to war against the Germans in the middle of the Holocaust, and we did. We're worried about the Israeli feelings? Are you insane? Children are literally going to starve to death today because of the god damn Israelis. And that is a fact. And if you say, oh, no, I found the real problem here: Cenk said *'god damn Israelis, that's an anti-semite, my feelings are hurt'*---I don't care about your feelings! And your feelings are racist! Say *'oh, yeah, Palestinians, murder their kids! Who cares? They're not human!'* You're a racist. You're a sick person. Don't you ever say anti-semite, don't you ever talk about bigotry. Don't you ever talk about anything if you're not fighting to end this genocide right now. You're a monster. You're a deeply evil, immoral person, and I don't care what you think. Oh, no, I get to say that. *'Oh, no, I get to say that---I'm the only one who's pure. Anyone who criticizes me, fire them! Arrest them!'* They're doing it today, guys! The stupid Trump administration: *'We're going to review 55 million visas, in case anyone is criticizing Israel---they'll be removed from the country.'*"<br>"And finally, that's the last point of it: Israel controls America. Saying anything otherwise is absurd. It's counter-factual. How could, in the middle of a famine, a forced famine, all of these dead children, 98 percent of our government is still kissing Israel's ass? Is pro-genocide? I accuse them! I accuse them of being deeply immoral scumbags! Oh, where's the money? Where's the money? Our politicians sicken me. And our media---oh, no no no, oh no no no no no, Congressional hearings on anti-semitism! *'Protect the poor Israelis! The real problem is how you guys are offending the Israelis! No, the politicians, they're not crooks. Ignore the AIPAC money! If you say AIPAC money, that's it, you're hateful. You know? Shut up! Lie on behalf of Israel. You have to lie on behalf of Israel.'* That's what mainstream media says. If you work at mainstream media and you still haven't called it a 'genocide', you're a coward. You're a snivelling, immoral, deeply evil coward. I'm sick of the people in power in this country using it to abuse people. They never help us. They never help us. We've given Israel 310 billion dollars. And then Israel comes and says 'you owe us'. 'You owe us'? Are you kidding me? We don't owe you a god damn thing. We should cut off Israel. They're not an ally. Let's be clear about it. No one has gotten us in more trouble, no one has caused more harm, no one has caused more wars in my lifetime than Israel. We... Israel is not our ally, at this point they are our enemy. They take money from us, they incriminate us to the whole world, they implicate us in their immoral war crimes. No one has hurt this country more than Israel has. Israel is our top enemy. Enemy. Cut off the god damn funding. You're taking my money to murder Palestinian children, you god damn racists. That's how I feel about it. Young Turks!"</section>  [src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQq6nvrfvQ8)
2025-09-08 | <section class="ie-expand">Cenk Uyghur: "I now think that I have seen the government do so many terrible things, uh, repeatedly and cover up for it repeatedly, that I am no longer sure. And when you see things like World Trade Centre 7, a building across the street, apparently was so hot that the steel inside the building melted from across the street, but the government found Muhammad Ata's paper passport conveniently on top of the rubble? Things that don't make any sense. So I'm not saying I know the answer, but I'm beginning to come to some conclusions about what is not the answer."<br>Ana Kasparian "I'm not running around saying 9/11 was an inside job. I'm not---I don't know. But I do know that there are some serious issues with what the, you know, accepted narrative is."<br>Tucker Carlson (in the clip they play): "What happened to building 7? Which was not only not next to the twin towers, but had a building in between itself and those buildings, collapsed that afternoon for reasons that no one has been able to explain since. You're not a lunatic for asking. There is no reason, there's no plausible explanation for that building collapsed." (Everything Tucker says here is a lie. The collapse of building 7 is well studied and what caused its collapse is understood and not difficult information to find.)<br>Cenk Uyghur: "I'm not a physicist. ... I got no expertise on that. Just---that building [tower 7], that is not anywhere near the other buildings, just melting down? I've never thought that made any sense." .. "I'm willing to get convinced on anything, but building 7 is a mystery that is nearly impossible." .. "The idea that the towers would collapse themselves, north and south, after they got hit, that the steel could burn so much that they could collapse, is a very controversial idea within engineering circles." .. "But a building across the street with other buildings in between? No, it's, the steel didn't burn down. No way. That is not the correct answer."<br>Cenk Uyghur: "When you turn back to 9/11, no, I don't know the answer, guys. I don't know who did it, and why they they did it, or maybe it did happen, just like October 7th, where it's not that Israel did it, but there was a weird stand-down order. Why was there a stand-down order? And that's not me saying it, that's IDF soldiers saying there was a stand-down order right at that exact time, when we never have a stand-down order. So that's not me saying Israel did it, that's me saying that's weird. And we need a plausible answer to that---not 'trust me bro', which is what the government's been doing the entire time."</section><br>(Summary of this video: Cenk and Ana both suggest 9/11 is a conspiracy theory and imply the Jews are behind it. Please note: they don't point out any actual problems with the 'official' narrative; we know what happened with tower 7 etc. They've just never bothered doing any research on this topic, even before filming a 20-minute segment where they endorse Tucker Carlson's conspircay theorist docu-series. Nice work, guys.) [src](https://youtu.be/Ey69sbYrx38?t=526)

'car accidents are more common!' to celebrating the gruesome murder of a husband, father, just a guy. not a politician, not a CEO- a fucking guy. for having normiecon campus conservative coworker politics. for the crime of not being a liberal, not believing in the current thing. it is clear how they reacted about charlie is how they would react about me, my friends, my family, any of you, your friends, your family that have ever stepped out of line of the nebulous ever changing definition of 'progressive', anyone who has ever been called a 'nazi' for the stupidest shit in the last 10+ years. charlie was staunchly right wing, but remember, none of you are pure enough. many things have made me feel this way over the years (dnc fucking bernie twice, covid lockdowns, trucker protest, being lied to about kyle rittenhouse and believing it like a moron, drag kid shit, being gaslit with the balenciaga 'drama', realizing 'adults should be able to do what they want' is becoming a fascist belief, the 'bike karen' lie, how they wanted Daniel Penny’s head for doing the exact community policing they talked about wanting, i can go on) but this week in particular has been eye opening. posting videos and pictures of charlie’s wife and young kids will not move them because they cannot relate and never will. they are atomized bug people who hate their families and themselves. the unfortunate product of modern society. they are miserable evil human beings and i owe many people many apologies for ever thinking otherwise. maybe i will calm down, but i couldnt sleep, but i am absolutely demoralized and blackpilled beyond belief. i do not want my child growing up in a world like this. sick evil shit."</section> [src](https://x.com/shoe0nhead/status/1966135535199527137) [img](media/shoe0nhead-20250911.jpg)

If Russia decides right now that an invasion into their territory is too much, and so they decide to just carpet bomb or nuke Ukraine, it's over.

There is a primal instinct in all animals that teach them the things they do. Much like a dog can swim without ever being taught, a third-world migrant behaves in the most primal ways by instinct. Rape, murder, criminality - these are things that are deeply embedded in the DNA of a third-world migrant. Can these things be trained away? Perhaps, for the truly intelligent ones who make an effort. But for your average one, they'll resort to primal instincts every single time. The only true solution to third-world migration is to reduce it to ZERO and have no tolerance whatsoever for it."

I don't see Latin American nations dealing with systematic replacement. It's only historically White nations that are dealing with systematic replacement. And it's the White leaders of these historically White nations that are systematically allowing their people to be replaced. Why are we not allowed to mention that without being called racists?"

Through mutual aid, through civil disobedience, through active resistance and organizing. We can overcome. We would never overcome the moral stain of re-electing genocide. It would have undercut any moral authority. It would have metastasized. As godawful as Trump is, it was the better outcome. Now, let's organize to bury fascism (again, but this time for real and that means ending capitalism)" [src](https://x.com/CallForCongress/status/1889238467047243954)
