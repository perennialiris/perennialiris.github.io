# Liberalism, not extremism

.2025-09-19

In the French revolutionary period, when the National Assembly was organized, supporters of the monarchy sat on the right side of the hall, while supporters of the revolution sat on the left. This arbitrary seating arrangement is the origin of the way we talk about politics today, through the lens of left and right, where left means motion and progress and change, and right means resistance and order and establishment. This pair of concepts has had enduring appeal---though, being one-dimensional, it does impose some limitations. If there's only one dimension, then you might assume it divides politics in two, as it was in the National Assembly, and so if your country is fighting against a right-wing threat, then anybody on the left wing should be your ally in that fight, and vice versa. In reality, extremists make unreliable allies, and they're more likely to backstab you in effort to take power for theirselves.

As we currently live, ideologically, in most ways, in the remnants of the Second World War, the far-left and far-right both engage in aggressive historical revisionism concerning the events thereof, and of the first half of the 20th century in general. The far right in infamous for downplaying the Holocaust in various ways (perhaps the numbers are severely exaggerated, or perhaps they weren't really intended to be death camps until the destruction of their supply lines led to war-time starvation), or for trying to suggest the war was really Britain's fault, that Hitler wanted peace, and that Allied leaders were comparably monstrous in their own ways.

The far left has an equally insidious retelling and twisting of events---but it's one that people fall for more easily, because it concerns parts of history that are less emphasized and contested than the legacy of Nazism and the Holocaust.

In most European countries, the monarchist governments of previous centuries were dismantled by liberal republican reformists who created democratic governments in their place. In some countries (England, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain), the monarchy was never formally abolished, but abdicated all or nearly all of its governing authority to a democratic parliament of some kind. A number of these liberal revolutions happened in 1848 (**revolutions of 1848**). Another wave of revolutions happened throughout Europe after the end of the first World War (Italy, Germany, Russia, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and others). These periods of upheaval are risky because your institutions are unstable throughout them. This means there's opportunity in which some well-organized extremists can swoop in and seize the day.

In Italy, for example, years of conflict against the monarchy failed to dislodge the Italian king---but then Benito Mussolini, founder the Italian fascist party, and who had organized his followers into a paramilitary force now known as the blackshirts, marched on Rome and took control of government in a coup d'etat. The Italian king, recognizing the day was lost and choosing to avoid necessarily bloodshed, surrendered his power to Mussolini, who ruled as dictator of Italy until his defeat in WWII 20 years later.

## Russia

A similar thing happened in Russia. In early 1917, widespread opposition to the government of Tsar Nicholas II (the **February Revolution**) led to his abdicating his position and the formation of the Russian Provisional Government in March, with the first elections in Russian history to be held later that year---but it wouldn't last. Instead, the most extreme faction that participated, a party called the Bolsheviks, who were unable to gain power democratically, flipped the table. Their supporters, organized and militant, attacked the new government (**October Revolution**), destroyed the burgeoning Russian democracy, and established a one-party state with the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin ruling as its first dictator until his death in 1924. They outlawed all opposition parties, and never held elections again. A civil war broke out (Russian Civil War), and the new Bolshevik government emerged victorious, leading to the official formation of a new political entity called the Soviet Union, which would rule over Russia until 1991.

In the years after Lenin took power, he oversaw a period of widespread political repression now known as the Red Terror, in which Bolshevik militants purged dissent across the countryside, publicly torturing and executing anybody they considered rebels to discourage anybody standing up to their newfound authority. The regime Lenin started, and which Joseph Stalin inherited from him, was a repressive, militant, imperialist, authoritarian society, that utilized slave labour, that had no freedom of expression, that employed aggressive propaganda and suppression of the truth, that enforced laws against homosexuality, and that engaged in genocide against groups that fought back against being ruled over by them. It didn't even achieve any meaningful freedom for the working class, which was supposed to be the whole point of their movement when it began.

The Bolsheviks, like the fascists in Western Europe, would proclaim they were acting on behalf of the people, despite not gaining power democratically, and having to repress democracy throughout their entire time in power because they know they couldn't have maintained their power democratically. Instead, they would merely invoke some abstract, spiritual notion of "the people" that could never be measured and which had no specific, concrete form outside the mind of the dictator, whom we just had to trust was somehow, someway, acting in our interests. This perversion of democratic rhetoric is a deliberate form of propaganda.

And never fall for this excuse: that Russia could not have been democratic, because most people in the country were illiterate or living in rural settings with little political education. The same excuse is sometimes used for China's Communist dictator, Mao, who was equally repressive to democracy for the entirety of his life. This could be dismissed for its absurdity anyway, but we also have a convenient counter-example in India, a country that transitioned to a democracy from a similar starting position by sending canvassers across the countryside to reach people in every little town and village and teach them about how their new government worked and provide information about the political parties and their platforms. That's what political leaders do when they actually value democracy. It takes some work, but it's entirely possible. Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and other Communist leaders didn't do the work not because it couldn't be done, but because they didn't value democracy.

The far left today will try to deceive you about almost every detail of the above. They evade the circumstances in which the Soviet Union was formed, hoping you'll assume it was a revolution of the people, not simply a military coup d'état. They also downplay the horrors and crimes of the Soviet Union, trying to whitewash what its leaders did, and in many cases trying to shift all blame to Joseph Stalin, as though Vladimir Lenin wasn't equally monstrous. There are some people who say things would've been much better if only Leon Trotsky had taken over instead, but there's no reason to think this. A review of his writing and character leads me to suspect a Trotsky-led USSR would've been even worse. In summary, if you praise and want to emulate the Soviet Union today, then you're really no better than a fascist trying to downplay the crimes of Nazi Germany.

## Germany

This brings me to the German revolution in 1919, which successfully overthrew the German monarchist system and established a democratic republic with hardly any bloodshed. The German far-left then initiated a violent uprising against this new government, hoping to take advantage of the instability and chaos in the country to take power for theirselves and rule over society like what happened in Russia. This became known as the **Spartacus uprising** and, fortunately, after about a week it had failed and the Communist militants were defeated. In the aftermath of that defeat, some leaders of the German communist party, the most well-known of them today being a writer named Rosa Luxemburg, were killed by military irregulars called the Freikorps, which the German government had employed to help put down the revolt.

To this day, the far left, in a display of ironic absurdity, acts as though this sequence of events constitutes the centre, the liberals and democrats and republicans, turning on and backstabbing the Communists, when the exact reverse is true. Germany had just succeeded in becoming a democracy but was still on shaky ground, and the extremists decided they would throw the rest of their society under the bus in order to drag Germany back into authoritarianism but this time with theirselves at the helm. Modern far-left groups also commemorate and mourn the death of Luxemburg as though she were an innocent saint, a victim of liberal treachery, and not somebody who was actively inciting and cheering on a violent insurrection that sought to destroy a democratic government. To be sure, her death was effectively a vigilante execution, like the Communist militants who captured and shot Mussolini, not an outcome of real justice---but it remains that she was not a good or honourable person, and if she had had her way, she would have brought tyranny to the world. Her place in history should be akin to the minority factions within the Nazi Party whom Hitler had purged from the party in 1933 (the Night of the Long Knives).

Throughout the 1920s, the Nazi party came into its own as a rising force in Germany. They began winning seats in the German parliament and organized their supporters into a paramilitary force now known as the brownshirts, officially the **Sturmabteilung** or SA ("storm division"), who roamed the country intimidating if not attacking their opposition, trying to make it more difficult for other parties to organize. In years to come, using their brownshirt militias to engage in widespread voter intimidation would be a key tactic in how the Nazis seized control of government.

The German communist party began forming similar groups around this time for their own activities. At this point the German communist party was funded and effectively controlled by the Cominterm, an international communist organization headed by the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin, whose goal was to foment communist revolution in other countries. The German communist leader was an admirer of Stalin, and wanted to bring that same style of revolution and authoritarian repression to Germany.

To combat the growing threat of extremist violence, a paramilitary counterforce called the **Iron Front** was formed (Dec 16, 1931), officially independent but associated with the centre coalition and especially the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the largest party in the German parliament at the time which led a coalition government with the Centre Party and the German Democratic Party. This coalition included a broad range of people, including socialists, but they were united in wanting to defend democracy from the threat posed to it by anti-democratic extremism, like the Nazis and Communists. The Iron Front provided security at events, got into street brawls with brownshirts, and were known for defacing Nazi propaganda with their own logo, the three arrows.

In the following year (May 26, 1932), the German Communists responded by centralizing *their* paramilitary efforts into a new front they called **Anti-fascist Action**. A modern reader may see this name and think they were joining the fight against Nazism, but no---the Communists of the 1920s and 30s were using the term "fascism" as a label for practically anybody who wasn't also a communist. The name "antifa" was chosen to signify opposition to anybody who stood in their way, including the social democrats. They explicitly identified not the brownshirts but the Iron Front as their main enemy. AntiFa was, in practice, not an anti-fascist organization so much as it was as an authoritarian, anti-democratic organization; and the fight in Germany was not left versus right, but democracy versus the forces of Nazism and Communism. The far left and far right were aligned in their desire to overthrow the republic, both motivated by the hope that they would come out on top in the aftermath.

The Communists, in effect, helped Nazis come to power. This was true not only in the street brawls, but also in government: a good portion of the electoral support for the Nazi party came from fear about the very real threat of Communism. Germans knew of the Red Terror, and they knew the Soviet government was now trying to meddle in their affairs via the Communist party, and they knew the German communist leader wanted to follow in Russia's footsteps. The insanity of Communists made centrists and moderates see the Nazis as the less destructive of the two. If the only way for the republic to survive was to ally with one extremist wing to defeat the other (as with each election the support for the centre coalition was falling, and the Nazi and Communist parties were gaining seats), then allowing Hitler a seat in government was a bitter pill that moderates accepted only because Communists managed to look even worse. (Though this was probably helped by the fact they had a real-world example of the horrors of Communism playing out in the east, whereas the horrors of Nazism were still yet to come. At this point, nobody in Germany knew how bad things were going to get.)

The far left today, in their recounting of this history, will skip over almost all of this. They'll point out that Communists wanted to resist fascism and the original "anti-fa" was created by the far left, dishonestly leaving you to make wrong assumptions about the nature of this opposition and of that organization. They'll repeat the Bolshevik accusation that the centrist liberal-democrats were somehow also fascists, perhaps repeat the German Communist Party's claim that they were "the only anti-fascist party" in Germany, hoping you'll assume this was because Communists felt the centrists weren't being strong enough in their opposition to Nazism, and not because Communists hated democracy even more than they hated Nazis. They want to obscure the real history for the same reason that Nazis do.

## Defeating the Nazis

After WWII, the only thing everybody agreed on was that Nazi Germany was bad. There is, for this reason, a certain pride in claiming to be the ones who defeated Nazism. If you talk to a member of the left today, they will claim it was the Soviet Union. They may further abstract things and say that Communism is what brought down Hitler. This despite the facts I outlined about Hitler's rise to power above.

Americans like to celebrate the Allied victory in World War II as part of their own military history, which is a great thing to celebrate. A point that's sometimes made, though, is how the US wasn't formally part of the war until 1941, and only entered after they were attacked (by Japan). They certainly helped win the war, but they didn't enthusiastically sign up to participate the way Britain did. However, the same can be said about the Soviet Union. In 1939, after Adolf Hitler had taken full control of government, and only weeks before Britain would declare war on Germany (Aug 24 vs. Sept 3), the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression agreement with the Nazis called the Molotov--Ribbentrop Pact (named partly for the Russian diplomat Vyacheslav Molotov, now most famous for being the person after whom Finnish rebels named the Molotov cocktail). The only reason the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany ended up at war against one another is because Nazi Germany broke this agreement by attacking the Soviet Union two years later, in the June of 1941.

The far left emphasizes how the Soviet Union suffered heavy casualties. Somehow, they suffered more losses than any other participant in the war, and were the only country that had more military deaths than Nazi Germany itself. The tactics used by both sides of the Eastern Front (the warfare happening in Europe to the east of Nazi Germany) were particularly brutal, as these countries had some of the least ethical approaches to warfare, and the Nazis approached it as a war of extermination: they wanted to control this area permanently and have ethnic Germans settle it, and they were torching entire Russian villages along the way. The Soviet Union mobilized far more people than any other country in absolute numbers---but their military wasn't well-prepared; their troops were poorly organized, poorly equipped, and lacking in good leadership. This was a problem exacerbated by an authoritarian government that purged experienced officers to root out people who were insufficiently loyal to Stalin. The German military was far more effective and had technological superiority---though if Nazi Germany went on for long enough, I'm sure *their* authoritarian political culture would result in the same loss in effectiveness that the Red Army was already experiencing.

Further contributing factors include how, by the late 1930s, the remaining commanders in the Red Army, like Stalin himself, had a much higher tolerance for casualties than the military leadership of other countries. This disregard for your own people's life is also a common byproduct of authoritarian regimes: there is no opposition party, and they don't need to worry about being criticized at home, or needing to win reëlection. As such, they prioritize victory, even at great cost. Stalin himself remarked that the war will be won by numbers. They knew Russia had the largest population of any country in Europe, and they used this to their advantage, realizing that even if they lost more men per battle than the Nazis, the Nazis would run simply out of people before they do.

However, even if the Soviet Union were an effective fighting force that was enthusiastic to fight the Nazi menace, and not simply a self-sacrificial meat grinder that only got dragged into the war because its attempt at avoiding conflict with the Nazis failed, there is still a very important fact yet being overlooked: England and America liberated; the Soviet Union conquered. What is there to celebrate in one authoritarian regime taking land from another? England and America freed as many people as they could from being ruled by Nazis to allow those people independence. The Soviet Union tried to take the Nazis' place. They militarily dominated all of Eastern Europe, ruling over those people with an iron fist, against their rule, crushing any rebellion. If the West was not so completely spent in resources by the end of the war, it'd have been no less unjust to march into Moscow and free the people of eastern Europe from the Bolshevik dictatorship than it was to do so in Italy. The Soviet Union was *horrible*---in the war, she was an ally of convenience only, and the moment the more immediate threat of Nazi Germany was defeated, she returned to being an enemy.

Which is more than one can say about Communists in the West.

## A centrist identity

Speaking historically, I say Communists and Nazis were on the same level: authoritarians, advocates of tyranny, enemies of liberty and democracy. However, today the threat level is not the same. We find ourselves under assault primarily by the far right. There are some Communists in our midst, but not as many, and they have very little power. The far right has successfully infiltrated and taken over whole political parties and governments. They control the United States executive branch and have significant sway over its parliament and judiciary. In other countries, similar groups are rising, and they need to be fought against.

The problem, and the reason I bring attention to this matter now, is that in this fight, more people need to realize that Communists and other far-leftists are not your friends. In the fight against fascism, the far left will always backstab you and help fascism win, because they hate liberalism and democracy more than they hate fascism. These people may as well be controlled opposition. If you allow them into your movement, or your political party, or into your coalition, they will pursue a singular goal: destroying the organization in question so they can take it over. They will divide everybody, they will spend more time attacking you than the right, and they won't care whether your movement wins or loses. They are cancer.

To return to my opening point: I understand why somebody might assume that if you want to build a coalition to defeat the far right, you would include the far left, but that's simply misguided. Instead of a negative identity that's simply "anything not of the far right", we need a positive, centrist, pro-democracy identity, one that opposes Nazism without including Communism and opposes Communism without including Nazism. We need something like the centre coalition and the Iron Front. And there's ample material with which to build such an identity. We just need to do the work of putting it together and articulating it.
