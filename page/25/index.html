# Ilhan Omar's comments about Somalia

There had been no Muslims to serve in the US House of Representatives until 2019 when **Ilhan Omar** was elected to represent a district in Minnesota (another Muslim woman was elected at the same time, making Omar tied for first Muslim). The result of her being a Muslim is that some people are more sensitive to her comments. There was chatter in 2019 about how she referred to the 9/11 attacks as the time "some people did something", despite this being [an off-the-cuff phrasing in a long speech that was primarily about something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INpvY0J0RI) (think of the emphasis: "because *some people* did something, *all of us* were starting to lose access to our civil liberties"). Those few words were clipped from the rest of the event, circulated on social media wildly, and people were literally showing up to events with "some people did something" shirts because they were so outraged that somebody could be slightly flippant about it---or, more frankly, that a Muslim would dare to be. Nobody who was upset about Omar's phrasing would have cared if Trump or some other white Christian guy had said the exact same thing.

In January 2024, a more 'serious' controversy arose after Omar gave a speech in Minneapolis in her native Somali and allegedly proclaimed [she's working in Congress to represent the interests of Somalia and her fellow Somalians](https://twitter.com/MarinaMedvin/status/1751751864167661750). The role of a US politician is not to represent the interests of another country. The fact this speech wasn't in English complicates the matter because people can argue about the correct translation of her words, and slight differences in wording can make a big difference on this topic.

Ilhan Omar was born in **Somalia** in 1983, then fled to the US in '95 at age 13 due to the [Somali Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Civil_War). The country fell into instability and conflict, leading to it being labelled a 'failed state' in the 1990s, and the civil war has yet to be fully resolved. **Somaliland** is a separatist region that emerged out of this conflict and which currently operates independently, to the dismay of the rest of Somalia, as ruled by the president and military in the southern capital of Mogadishu.

In 2024, the neighbouring Ethiopia came to a [memorandum of understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Ethiopia%E2%80%93Somaliland_memorandum_of_understanding) (MoU) with Somaliland. Ethiopia would gain access to the gulf of Aden in exchange for recognizing Somaliland as an independent state, making Ethiopia the first country to do so globally.

From the perspective of Somalis in the south, Somaliland is a rogue state that has stolen land from Somalia and is now giving land rights away without their permission. This is what prompted Omar to speak on the issue. When she references "people who call theirselves Somalis" (below), she means the people of Somaliland, and the implication is they aren't *true* Somalis because they're betraying Somalia.

I don't think anybody cares about the Somalia--Ethiopia conflict. It's the other things she said in this speech that got reactions. According to the translation of her speech that circulated online, she said:

||indent
We, as Somalians, we love each other. There are areas of friction and that led us to kill each other, but in reality we are an organized society, brothers and sisters, people of the same blood, people who know they are **Somalians first, Muslims second**, who protect one another, come to each other's aid and to the aid of other Muslims too.
A couple of days ago, we heard some people who call theirselves Somalis have signed an MoU with Ethiopia on access to the sea. Many Somalians have personally called me to encourage me to speak to the US government and help Somalia. They wanted to know what the US government could do for Somalia to ensure the MoU never turns into a full bilateral agreement.
My answer to Somalians was that the US government will only do what Somalians in the US tells them to do. They will do what we want and nothing else. They must follow our orders and that is how we will safeguard the interest of Somalia. We Somalians must have that confidence in ourselves that we call for the shots in the US. We live in the US, pay taxes in the US and have a real voice.
The US is a country where **one of your daughters** [herself] **is in congress to represent your interest**, for as long as I am in the US Congress, Somalia will never be in danger, its waters will not be stolen by Ethiopia or others. The US would not dare to support anyone against Somalia to steal our land or oceans. Sleep in comfort, knowing I am here to protect the interests of Somalia from inside  the US system.
The woman you sent to Congress [herself] is working day and night to protect your interest, she knows your plight and that of Somalia. **I am as concerned about Somalia as you guys are. Together we will protect the interests of Somalia.**
President Hassan Sheikh [president of Somalia] has done a remarkable job in looking after Somalia. Mr. President, you have done an excellent job and we are happy about it. You spoke to Somalians dispersed across the world that you are there to look after Somalia. However weak it [Somalia] is, or if it is a failed state, **we Somalians are resilient people who can fight against all odds, people who love their country**, we are people who will never allow someone else to steal our land.
--- Ilhan Omar

The popular response was: girl, are you Somali or American? Pick a lane, because you can't be both. I'm not sure where this translation came from, but it was the first version that made the rounds on social media. [Omar herself replied calling the translation inaccurate](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1751719238316724330), and others weighed in, for example Somali translator named Aziz Mahdi who claimed the translation [fails to accurately convey the essence of her talk, leading to a distorted understanding of her message](https://x.com/AMAGuudcadde/status/1751975297900036534). There were some people who offered better versions of the translation, such as Abdirashid Hashi, who shared what he claims was [a more reasonable translation](https://x.com/AnalystSomalia/status/1752061355530571978) of the same section of the speech on Twitter.

The Minnesota Reformer, a local outlet and part of the States Newsroom network (a nonprofit based in D.C. dedicated to state-level political coverage), pointed out [the first section of the transcript above is mistranslated](https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/01/republicans-smeared-ilhan-omar-over-a-faulty-translation-heres-what-she-really-said/) at a key point: where the viral translation had "Somalians first, Muslims second", Omar had actually said, simply, "Somali and Muslim". There was no mention of first and second, nor the implications that would be present in the English language if you said you were a given identity 'first' (implying primacy over all other identities). Whoever made the translation that went viral online added various notes like this to distort the intended meaning.

Ilhan Omar also [claimed](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1752094934759358560) (as did some other people) that Somalian people don't use the term 'Somalian' in reference to theirselves, instead preferring 'Somali'---insinuating the initial translation was made by somebody not familiar with the Somali language or politics.

Setting the "Somalian first" inaccuracy aside, it was further suggested that what Omar likely means in the later part of the excerpt is that she'll represent the interests not of Somalia as a country, but of the people of Somali descent living in Minnesota. Minnesota has [the largest Somali population in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Americans), most of whom fled the country in the 90s due to the Somalian Civil War, alongside Omar's family. However, is it appropriate to serve the interests of another country in order to serve the interests of a diaspora from that country in your country? It seems to only shift the issue---then again, isn't that what happens with other nationalities already? Cubans, let's say. A diaspora escapes to the US, and then expresses their political opinions about the situation still ongoing in the place they came from, and that can become part of the American strategy in that region. Their will becomes part of the American will, after all, and if we do something they don't like, they'll be disappointed and perhaps vote differently. If phrased the right way, this would likely be considered fine.

[As Nikki Ramírez (Rolling Stone) writes](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ilhan-omar-attacked-deportation-calls-mistranslated-speech-1234959112/), "the speech was not at all that different from the speeches lawmakers from immigrant backgrounds or from districts with immigrant and minority populations regularly deliver." If Omar had expressed the same sentiments in English, and with better political tact, the message would likely not have been objectionable.

If you don't feel me, let's take a minute and pretend that I'm Omar's speechwriter. Here's my idea for what she could've said instead, to express roughly the same meaning without the controversy:

||indent
"We are Somali Americans, so we feel solidarity with the people of Somalia. And our opinion is that Somaliland is bad for the region, is unfairly splitting Somalia apart, and we think the right thing to do would be for the US to side with Hassan Sheikh, the current president of Somalia. And as citizens of America, we can express our political will in this country and have our opinion shape America's approach to that conflict, to side with Somalia over Somaliland and prevent Ethiopia taking advantage of the situation to steal Somalian land."
--- not Ilhan Omar

Though she didn't go over the whole speech, Omar [did later comment](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4440143-emmer-ethics-investigation-omar/) that "in the video, I support a unified Somalia, which aligns with longstanding US policy favoring a one Somalia approach. My stance remains consistent with the goal of a stable and unified Somalia."

**The response to the translation** of what Omar said, including by sitting US politicians, was extreme to a point of being ridiculous and even more offensive and un-American than the worst of what she may have said.

* **Tom Emmer**, a House Republican from Minnesota, called on her to resign. If he only saw the distorted version of what she said, maybe this is a reasonable reaction.
* **Ron DeSantis**, the Republican governor of Florida, publicly advocated for Omar to be not only expelled from Congress but for her to [lose her citizenship and be deported from the country](https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1752351036914667642).
* **Marjorie Greene**, a US House Rep from Georgia, went crazy, calling Omar a [terrorist sympathizer](https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1751806266651897869) who hates America, claimed Omar is "[acting as a foreign agent](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13034035/marjorie-taylor-greene-ilhan-omar-foreign-agent-somalia.html)", introduced a motion to [censure her and have her removed from](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4442166-greene-omar-censure-force-vote/) Congressional committees, and making public statements that [she should be deported from the country](https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1753074254017687819), publicly reading an *even further* distorted translation of what Omar said.

The fact Ms. Omar is a citizen of the United States does not seem to be of any concern to them. Asked for comment, Omar replied "I have nothing to say about the insanity of that woman".

Abdirashid Hashi
@AnalystSomalia
For those seeking an accurate and verbatim translation of what Congresswoman @Ilhan
 said, here it is:

[The context is: she was addressing her Somali-American constituents, who were alarmed by Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed’s announcement of his intention to assist a region/province in Somalia in becoming a sovereign state. Additionally, he stated he will acquire land and sea l for his landlocked country through this province. Somalia, the African Union, the USA, the European Union, the UK, and the global community stand with Somalia, stating that dismembering Somalia and annexing its land is unacceptable]

Here is what the Congresswoman said:

————————————————

“We Somalis are people who love each other. It is possible that some of us are rough with each other, but when the going gets tough, we are people who have each other’s backs. We are sisters and brothers, supporting each other, people who know they are Somalis and Muslims, coming to each other’s aid and aiding their brothers and sisters.

And the other day, when we heard that some Somalis, or those who say they are Somalis, entered an MoU with Ethiopia, many people called me and said, “Ilhan, you should talk to the US government; what is the US government going to do about this?”

My response was: the US government will do what we ask it to do. We should have this confidence in ourselves as Somalis. We live in this country. We are taxpayers in this country. This country is one where one of your daughters sits in Congress. While I am in Congress, no one will take Somalia’s sea. The United States will not back others to rob us. So, do not lose sleep over that, O Minnesotans. The lady you sent to Congress is on this, and she is as cognizant of this interest as you are.

I would like to tell President Hassan Sheikh that we are impressed with the great work you have done. You have made it known to those living in Somalia and other places that, in spite of the many challenges we face as Somalis, we are nonetheless competent people. People who believe in their country and will not allow it to be endangered. 

Thus, I want to congratulate the Somalis in Minnesota and everywhere on how united you are. How you all stood by our president, because he needs our solidarity. Somalia belongs to all Somalis. Somalia is one. We are brothers and sisters, and our land will not be balkanized. Our lands were taken from us before, and God willing, we may one day seek them, but what we have now will not be balkanized. 

I thank you all for how you always welcome me and honor me; may the Lord honor you. Peace and blessings of God be with you.
