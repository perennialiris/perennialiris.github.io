# Immigration

.2025-11-06

In recent years we've been seeing the rise of political parties that I very much oppose, full of criminals and liars and incompetent racists that I wouldn't trust with a lemonade stand. Their popularity is being fuelled almost wholly by opposition to immigration. There's big protests happening in Britain, Canada, Australia, and other countries I'm sure, whose only uniting message is this needs to stop. There's always been some immigration, and some opposition to immigration, but now the scale of it is unprecedented. The number of immigrants being allowed in is extremely high and it's causing mass unrest.

For me, the easy route would be to be pro-immigration. I could pick some low-hanging fruit and make fun of them, because there's never any shortage of stupid people who hate immigrants for bad reasons. I could do a whole spiel about how immigrants are by and large normal, innocent, well-meaning people, and even if you think there's too many of them it doesn't make sense to take that out on any individual person, nor to say such ignorant, hateful things about them and the cultures they came from. They don't deserve it.

Instead I'd like to challenge you in the other direction. The ignorance of some people doesn't make their opposition to immigration wrong. How can a human feeling be wrong, after all? If we all dislike something and it makes us unhappy, then it's a problem we need to talk about, no matter what that thing is, and no matter if you're satisfied with your ability to rationalize it. And apparently this is something people are willing to change their votes over, meaning even if you don't personally dislike the changing cultural and demographic landscape that mass immigration brings, you still have a reason to care about it: because if you don't, then you're creating a power vacuum for parties like the AfD, Reform UK, the Sweden Democrats, and others, to swoop in and vacuum up support from all those people whose feelings you're neglecting. Welcome to a democracy, where if a certain viewpoint is popular enough, you can't just sweep it under the rug.

For better or for worse, what we're seeing around the world is that too much immigration creates a backlash and by extension political instability. Part of the problem, of our inability to address and talk about this issue in a clear way, is that many people who oppose immigration don't know how to talk about it. They have *feelings* about it, but they lack the vocabulary to express what they're feeling in a way that doesn't just sound like dumb racism, and they're afraid of it *coming off the wrong way*. So instead, they find other talking points that communicate their position by proxy, to let you know where they stand, but in a way that doesn't really tell the whole story. They say they're just worried about crime. They're worried about immigrants having a downward pressure on low-skill wages or putting too much pressure on social services. They're not against immigration, they're only against *illegal* immigration. These aren't serious positions.

To be sure, there are some places, in some countries, where each of these things might be true. But even if all of it ended up being *untrue* in a given case, chances are it changes nothing.

* If I could show you that immigrants actually do *less* crime than we do, would you change your mind and be all for it? And want the number of immigrants to *increase*? No.
* What if we reformed the way our social safety net works for immigrants, to ensure they must be looking for work, and we had an effective system to prevent immigrants from coming here and exploiting welfare and the like? Still no.
* What if you talked to all the best economists in the world, and they could explain to you that taking in immigrants helps the economy far more than it harms it? In fact, the notion it has a downward effect on wages often isn't true either. That's an oversimplification. Immigrants can increase the average value of labour, they can increase the demand for labour by becoming businesspeople at a greater rate than the native population, as is often the case, and they can apply some downward effect on wages but be such a net gain for the economy that overall productivity gains more than make up for it. At the end of the day, the simple reality is that more people means more labour means more production means a bigger economy. I don't think there's anybody credible in the fucking world who actually thinks immigration is a net loss for GDP. If we could make that argument persuasively, would the opponents of immigration flip and become all for *increasing* how many immigrants come to the country, for the good of the economy? And again the answer is no, of course not.
* And perhaps the dumbest one, the idea they're only against it when it's illegal. So if we made it legal, that would fix things? They could all be granted amnesty tomorrow. Then it'd be legal. We put their names in the books, give them ID cards, have them sign up for everything the proper way. Then we could increase all our immigration caps, and everybody more who comes through as a result isn't an illegal anymore. They're just immigrants. Legal immigrants. More of them. Do they support that? No, of course not.

These common anti-immigration tropes are all just *excuses* -- things we *grasp at* to explain our position after the fact, because we don't know how to explain what's *really* going on, which is just that we don't like it. We don't like immigration. We like *a few* immigrants, maybe. A handful. But really *only* a handful. We don't like it if it feels like there's a lot of them.

## Why do people not like a lot of immigration?

Today, many of us can leave our homes, go outside, walk around our town, go to a park, into some shops, chat with people here and there, a neighbour in the bakery, that woman at the café, even people who are strangers to us, people we've never met before in our lives. And it all feels *right*. It's nice. It's natural. We feel *at home* in it, because it's *our culture*. We identify with it. We feel like we belong here. It's us. There's a feeling of community or togetherness or connection that comes with being part of a shared cultural sphere. And if you can walk by buildings that have been there for generations, and look at things that your ancestors built, that's all the better. We benefit a lot psychologically from a feeling of connection to our past, a feeling of continuity, a feeling that we're a part of a bigger, shared experience. It's humbling, but it also grounds and comforts you. None of this would be important to a robot, but it's important to us, as humans, the emotional meat-bags that we are. So if you want to govern a nation of humans, you have to care about things like this.

If a hundred thousand immigrants moved into the area tomorrow, then what happens? Even if they're all great people, who don't do any crime, they all came in legally, and the economy carries on as normal -- there is something being lost, something being taken from me. Not a literal object that I could hold in my hands, but an *experience*, a dynamic that used to be here but which is here no longer. You've effectively taken what used to feel like home and turned it into something that feels foreign to me. I no longer feel that sense of connection and belonging that I used to feel. You've made me a visitor in my own home. In a way, it's disrespectful, but that's trickier to express than when the topic of dispute is my apartment.

We don't like it when that happens to us. We just don't. Not in this country, not in any other country in the world. If any other nation were subjected to the level of immigration Canada and other first-world places have been experiencing, you'd get revolts anywhere else. It's the most natural response you could expect. This is a very real, and very human reaction to a serious thing happening to us. There's no getting around it or shrugging it off.

And it troubles me how many of us, in polite, liberal society, act so incredulous about this perspective, and treat it as nothing more than ignorant racism, considering how *sensitive* and *understanding* we are of how important people find things like identity, culture, and community in seemingly every other context. We understand it when talking about gentrification, when talking about the queer community, and we seem to understand it when talking about the culture and identity of the immigrants theirselves, or when talking about any other group of people in the world. It's fallen out of favour these days, but we used to talk a lot about globalization, the way that culture all over the world is becoming more similar to itself, and how there's something amiss about people in every country just watching Hollywood movies instead of every country having its own Hollywood. There's something that feels naturally, intuitively wrong to most people about the feeling that we're all just becoming more alike, especially because in practice that will mean the amplification of perspectives that come from the seats of power and wealth, and the people who have spoken the least already being the ones who don't get a turn, and who least comprise the content of our new, one-size-fits-all zeitgeist. Was this frivolous? Are all such immaterial concerns meaningless, to be simply stepped over in favour of economic advancements?

Let's put it like this: if millions of Americans were all moving into some other country, and the people there didn't like it, and said they were concerned about their own culture and their own experience and their own feeling of community walking down the street outside their homes, I don't think we'd just call them racist and say their feelings are invalid and expect they just shut up about it because the economy likes new labour inputs. Absurd as it is, many people would take their concerns more seriously than those of our own people today expressing the same.

Now, to belabour this whole point even further, let's take a step back for a moment. We live in a time where everything is getting weird. The survey data suggests we're all getting more depressed and lonely and feeling hopeless and detached, more alienated from our families, not as many friends, less relationships, fewer children, and it feels like a bunch of tech companies are on the verge of firing us all and having every creative endeavor that brings any semblance of joy and meaning to our lives being taken over by computers while we sit at home looking at our anti-social social media that's been taken over by robots pretending to be humans, trying to coax us into distrusting everything and feeling like we aren't enough and downloading one of their apps to sign up for more subscription gambling services.

Is there really no room in this discourse, about all the downsides of modern society and the plight of we, who live in this age of the unprecedented, for how many people in the world are all feeling like their countries are no longer their own, like they don't belong in their own communities anymore, the problem is only getting worse, and the people who are supposed to be their leaders are ignoring them? I feel like the child in the Emperor's New Clothes, having to say maybe their complaints are valid and something you shouldn't just scoff at. I think there's a real fucking problem here. It's a problem to which some people add a garnish of racism, and it's our responsibility to smack that down, but underneath that, there's a real fucking problem. If there was overwhelming crime in my community, I wouldn't want people to be racist about it, but I *would* want people to do something about the crime. The fact some people are racist about something doesn't make the thing itself disappear.

## What if you just don't relate to any of this?

And I should add that if you are seriously, honestly, from the bottom of your heart, somebody who *doesn't get it*, because *you* live in a city with tonnes of immigrants, and *you've* never had an issue with it, or *you* don't relate to these feelings I was describing earlier -- well, that's good for you, and I can't argue with that or persuade you to feel otherwise. But you have an obligation to accept the fact not everyone is like you. In this case, most people aren't. If I tell you that *family* is important to people, you can't raise your hand and I say "I was an orphan, so family isn't important to *me*, so *that's* not true". Sometimes, if your goal is accurate analysis, you have to accept that you're atypical in some ways. You can't always use yourself as a model by which to understand the masses.

I personally don't like going to concerts. I just don't appreciate the novelty of seeing things happen live. I'd rather watch the game at home than go to a stadium. I've done it. It's stupid. But clearly millions of people do enjoy those things, and I wouldn't be so stupid as to say that it's wrong to enjoy them, or for them to be unhappy if our society stopped holding public events like that. I'd say that I'm different. This is one way in which I'm *not* a reflection of everybody else. Politics isn't just about *you*.

## What about the economy?

The most common pro-immigration framing is to say (1) immigration is good for the economy, and (2) concerns about culture aren't sufficient grounds for neglecting the potential economic gains immigration has to offer. I accept (1). Immigration is good for our economy. I have serious questions about whether it's good to be brain-draining the most driven people from other country's economies, but if all you care about is your own country's productive capabilities, taking in new people is almost always a net benefit. I wouldn't dispute it. But I reject (2): this is merely a statement of opinion, not an argument nor something falsifiable. If we *must* put the matter in economic terms, then you should see 'cultural belonging'---or whatever name you give this quality I've been describing---perhaps 'avoiding the demographic and cultural shift that immigration causes'---as a thing many people are willing to 'purchase' with the foregoing of potential economic gains.

This should be understandable in common terms. I could have more money in my bank account at year's end if I lived in a smaller apartment and ate cheaper food. Am I wrong not to? I could also have less money if I took more time off. So in a sense, time off costs money. It costs the money that I could've made by working. We're always making trade-offs in our life, and the path of the greatest dollar value isn't always the correct answer. Sometimes we prefer a thing to money it costs us. That's what a purchase *is*. When you buy something at a store, you're losing money, but it's not a net loss for your life, because you're getting something in exchange. The only difference here is that some people trivialize the thing we'd be 'getting' by having less immigration, because it's intangible and a bit fuzzy and not everybody relates to it in the same way, even though it's perfectly evident that lots, and lots, and lots of people all value it and are willing to pay a price for it.

In less common terms, let's think of other intangible things. Imagine if the economy would get better, but as a trade-off, no more sunshine. An external night. Maybe a generous few hours of overcast every week or two. No more sunny days, no more sun tans at the beach, no sense having sunglasses anymore. Take some vitamin D, because you'll need it. How much is *having sunshine* worth to you? To us? How much more efficient would everything need to be to justify losing it? Let's try other examples: how about no more trees? They could still exist out in the woods, far away from any of us, otherwise the planet would suffer, but no more trees anywhere near where humans live, in our towns and cities and parks. They all disappear. How about no more art, or music, or colour, or flavour in our food? Do we need to commodify everything in order for it to have any value, and not be a meaningless abstraction that you can just dismiss out of hand? It feels silly having to talk in this way, but that's where the rhetoric about immigration leads.

The response, ultimately, to somebody pointing out that immigration could benefit the economy, is: "that's a price I'm willing to pay".

## How much immigration is acceptable?

The ideal number, if you ask me, isn't zero. Zero wouldn't be a tragedy, but if we literally never had any foreigners, life would be, if ever so slightly, more boring, don't you think? Being able to meet somebody who's rather different from you, who comes from far away? It's an interesting experience. It's the reason many people enjoy travel. Even in a world of zero immigration, there could be tourism, though. And the world needs diplomats, and other positions like that, which involve travelling around to other places, and maybe settling down. Who knows. And we end up letting in select foreigners to help with a particular sector of the economy where the domestic labour pool is lacking.

That's the incredible short-term advantage of immigration: it lets you access the labour power of skilled adults immediately, without the time and resource investment of having to birth and raise and train them. It's workers, without the wait. If you're in need of doctors as soon as possible, hiring people from other countries who've already got medical degrees is a quicker way to plug that hole than waiting for more of your own people to get some. But you don't need to give somebody citizenship or even a *permanent* residency status just to come here and do a job they're already being paid fairly to do. We have something called a work visa. Just give them one of those.

In the big picture, realistically speaking, I don't think anyone is against *some* level of immigration. They're against *overwhelming* immigration. It's just a problem of quantity. Canada is one of the countries that has it the worst by sheer numbers. Over a fifth of the country's population are now immigrants. In 2024, another 400,000 new immigrants came in, the most in recent decades. This for a country that only has 40 million people. If we cut that down to a tenth of what it is, accepting only 40,000 per year, that would still be more than I'd prefer, but it would certainly be a move in the right direction. Perhaps enough to quell people's concerns for the time being, to have immigration fall down our list of priorities and other political questions take centre stage again. But it's pointless to quibble about the ideal number when the number we currently have is so insanely fucking high. It's like asking the ideal temperature for my house while it's on fire. Instead of searching for the ideal number, let's focus on 'less'.

## Refugees

A tricky issue is refugees. To accept them into your country is the right thing to do. It's the moral thing to do. It's the Christian thing to do. If somebody is coming to us in desperation because their country got taken over by a dictator who's going to murder them for being born the wrong race or something, what kind of people are we if we turn them away? If our answer is "nope, sorry, not our problem, the gates are staying up"? I ask anybody to declare this is their position in good conscience.

In practice, we don't save *everybody* we could. We could be spending more resources going around saving people from malaria in other countries, and we just don't. We're not really maximizing our "deaths prevented" counter, even though that seems like it would be the right thing to do. And when it comes to refugees? Same story. Whatever number we're taking in, I'm sure we could be taking in *more*. Last year, Canada accepted 40,000 refugee claims. Is that *everybody* who needs our help? I doubt it. But we only allocate so many resources to processing these claims and having these people settled. And if a politician or political party tried to throw *more* resources at it, voters might be unhappy, because we're not perfect and people don't have unlimited compassion, especially when they have their own problems they want politicians to be addressing. And the refugees aren't stood suffering in front of them. Out of sight, out of mind. The idea that other people in the world need our help stays a bit abstract. So even if you're a paragon of charity, there are certain political realities you need to work within. If you get on stage and say "I'm going to have our country take in as many refugees as we can afford", people just won't vote for you.

If you ask me, ideally, we'd be accepting *more* refugees, from places it's truly needed. There have been refugees from Haiti in recent years, before that from Syria, from Somali, recently from Afghanistan, and people fleeing persecution from countries like Iran. But if you're coming here because it's necessary for your own safety, then shouldn't the understanding be that you go back when it's safe? Instead, we grant them permanent residency, and then if they have any children over the next 100 years, their kids are automatically *citizens*? I don't have a comprehensive solution for what a refugee system ought to look like, but there's something about how it works *now* that doesn't seem right.

## Birthright citizenship

It's become rather fashionable in the last few years to question birthright citizenship, which is incredible for me because I spent so many years feeling alone in making the same points I now hear from others. Why is birthright citizenship even a thing to begin with? The answer is there was no system set up. We didn't have processing centres and offices for applications, but nor did we have the resources to police these vast borders to keep people out. There was an enormous landmass and we wanted Europeans to come make their lives here, so we made it as easy, intuitive, and streamlined as possible. Just show up, you don't have to do any paperwork or pass any sort of test, and your whole bloodline will end up being citizens, guaranteed.

I don't see any reason for this to still be how things work today, except that nobody ever bothered to get rid of it, but now it poses some obvious problems. Not only does it no longer reflect the reality of how anyone views countries and citizenship, but it's easily abused. In the United States, they've long had a term for it: an anchor baby. It's not a nice term, but it describes how even if you sneak into the country *illegally*, all you have to do is have sex and have a child, and your child gets to be a citizen, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. And in many cases, the child being a citizen made it easier for the parents to end up staying as well. And the same applies to other New World countries. There are people who set up trips, time their flights, trying to come to our countries just to give birth so their children get to be citizens of our country, and then in some cases they leave, going back home with a golden ticket in their back pocket, probably laughing about how dumb our laws are. It's called birth tourism.

There are no European countries that work this way. Hopefully we'll get rid of it too, at some point.

## The plight of many immigrants

Throughout all of this, I discourage anybody from casting their feelings about the way their culture is shifting into feelings of hatred toward immigrants. I don't just say this once to save face and move on, as though to provide cover for those who agree with me on the issue but who *are* hateful about it. This is an important distinction. And we can do more than simply *not be racist*. We should be actively empathetic. We should try to understand what immigrants are going through. And help them. If you live near immigrants, or if you work with immigrants, learn about them, connect with them. Help them acclimate to life in your country. It's good of you.

In Canada, there's been a problem of people getting lured here from other countries, often by the promise of a much better life than they end up finding after they arrive. They might spend a lot of money to enrol in what turns out to be a 'diploma mill', meaning a bullshit organization that purports to be a university and abuses the immigration system to get you into the country, but then more or less scams you and takes your money but doesn't teach you anything or leave you more employable than you were before. It's a tough spot to be in because they're not familiar with our systems or laws, they don't know where to go, who to talk to. Then they're here, and housing is a lot, and nobody wants to hire them to do anything advanced, so they end up working full-time at some unskilled labour job, serving coffee or flipping burgers, running delivery, just to afford a small apartment. And then where do they go from there?

I can only imagine how difficult it is not only to be struggling and impoverished, but doing so in an unfamiliar place, without much of a support system, where you don't have your family with you, you don't speak the language here very well. The immigrant experience often sucks. It's not easy and it's not pleasant. It's not always the cheat code to the good life they may have thought they were signing up for.

I often think about the cold, as well. It's not a problem if you're immigrating to California or some other place where it's very temperate, but in Canada it gets cold, and there's a lot of people who immigrate here who've never even seen snow before. It doesn't snow in southern India. It doesn't get that cold. Then they come here, and they have to go to work when it's –20 outside? They've never experienced that before. I was out recently, and I saw an Indian man, a young guy, riding a bike, with one of those huge square backpacks, doing food delivery. It's cold out today, and it's only going to be getting colder soon. Is this where he thought his life would end up? Riding a bike in the cold, to bring white people their food they didn't feel like going to get theirselves? I wonder how many of them would teleport back to where they came from if they could. Maybe this is still a step up for him, but the point is, he's out there working. He's doing what he has to do, and it's not a free ride. If he ends up with a better life for himself and his children, it's by having initiative and perseverance, coming here and accepting this is his life now. It's admirable.

## Problematic cultural values

Not all cultures are equal. I don't have a complex hierarchy. There's no "best culture". It's very subjective. But there are some cultures that are less developed, more brutal and repressive, less egalitarian. A member of such a culture might not see that as a problem. From their perspective, perhaps their culture is superior to ours. But from my perspective, it's the other way around. I would say their values are worse, in the same way that I'd say their technology is worse. Their culture is similar to what ours was hundreds of years ago, and given enough time I expect they will trend in our direction; but I shouldn't be obliged to endure it while waiting for that change to happen.

And part of the social cost of immigration can be the adverse influence of foreign cultures. This is not *always* a concern. In many places, immigrants are largely powerless and don't have much effect on the culture of the people around them. There are many immigrants who have values contrary to ours, but keep to theirselves. There are even many immigrants who make an effort to mostly *abandon* the values of where they came from, and adopt how things are done here. Those are the best immigrants of all. But in some cases, enough immigrants accumulate in one place, and are able to interact with each other and form a community there, and are still very much attached and loyal to their old culture, which they are then able to exert onto the space around them. It happens. And where that happens, it's a fair thing to dislike, because some of these people have very bad views and attitudes about certain things.

A common culprit of this behaviour in many countries is Muslims, who form Islamic communities and can be rather brazen about their values and preferences. It makes sense they would be, considering the narrative that god is on their side, and the history of violence, conquest, and empire that has been directly connected with the religion. The average Muslim around the world today isn't a crusader, but they do hold beliefs and attitudes that are generally incompatible with our society. They have backwards attitudes about women. They're completely intolerant of the gay and trans community, or of any looser expressions of sexuality. Their societies don't have a tradition of liberty or tolerance in the way ours do. They think leaving the religion is a cardinal sin. And their religion provides them with a narrative that may encourage trying to enforce these values onto others, if and when they can. What happens when there's a lot of Muslims in a country who can vote and exert some political will? Or a lot of Muslims in a neighbourhood, who you'll have to deal with on the street, or at a park? This isn't always a problem. It depends. There are plenty of Muslim-background people who aren't a problem at all. But it *can* be one. I don't want to deal with some of the negative aspects of their culture being imposed onto me. I don't want it in my community. I don't want to deal with people who think this way.

But nothing about the case against immigration that I articulated earlier requires the culture of the immigrants being inferior to ours. We could respect the culture of an immigrant group as being essentially on the same level as ours, but being *different*, and that is enough that people may become disconnected from their community and culture as a result. There would just as well be a case if millions of immigrants were coming here from, say, France, or Japan, or some other country that's rather different from us but whose culture is not generally one we look down on.

## Assimilation

When I say that part of the cost of immigration is cultural shift, a response I sometimes receive is: "But what if the immigrants assimilate?" This means, if they adopt our culture entirely. If that were the case, then for my purposes, there would be no issue at all. In fact, I strongly suspect that most ire about immigration would disappear overnight if all immigrants spoke perfect English. The communication barrier adds a lot to the feeling of distance.

However, it's a question whose answer gets no use in practice, because generally speaking, immigrants don't assimilate. I don't expect them to. We shouldn't even be talking about this so lightly. It's a lot to ask. To assimilate culturally is not easy. It's practically impossible for many immigrants. It's easier when you're younger, but a lot of immigrants who come in are more set in their ways. Even the children of immigrants will sometimes maintain significant cultural difference with those around them due to the household environment in which they're raised.

Assimilation is typically something that happens over a few generations, but it happens more quickly if you're fully immersed in another culture, and if you're consciously trying to assimilate. These two conditions are often not met, and the former---cultural immersion---is less and less likely the more immigrants there are in total. If you only have one immigrant family in your town and the parents are not very strict, there's a good chance their children will grow up to be just like us. They'll speak like us, they'll have all the same cultural touchstones as we do. They will be one of us. That's the result of their immersion. If they grow up in an immigrant part of town interacting primarily with other immigrant families, that is no longer as likely.

There are also immigrants who consciously resist assimilation. In fact, they would be offended by your suggestion that they abandon the culture and identity of the places they came from to adopt ours instead. They don't consider assimilation a good thing. In some places, in some communities, assimilation is a dirty word. It's something you don't want to do. It means losing yourself, and becoming like *them* (like us, that is). They look down on it.

So I don't think assimilation is a big part of the conversation. It's not a consideration that changes much, aside from that an individual immigrant who *wants* to assimilate is a nice thing. I've met some immigrants like that. I once knew a young woman from Turkey whose attitude about Turkey was very negative, to put it softly. She simply wanted to be Canadian, and did her best to adopt Canadian norms and style and so forth. I think immigrants like that pose less of a social cost than others. But that's not most immigrants, so it just doesn't matter that much overall.

## Going forward

I think that, in a way many people don't seem to have figured out yet, immigration is one of the biggest issues in the world right now. It's going to become this generation-defining divide, the question of demographics and culture and national identity.

It's also one of the major forces that stands in contradiction to the workings of capitalism, because it doesn't serve the interests of private companies. They don't care about your culture. They want labour and productivity. In the past, they had to worry about socialism and labour unions and so on, but now there's other forces to compete with them: this and environmentalism. Changing demographics and a changing environment: two things regular people oppose, but which private, for-profit companies are fine with. There's going to be conflict there. And that's what I saw the beginnings of in the H-1B visa disagreement in America earlier this year.

I believe the status quo on immigration, or maybe what the status quo has been over the last 10 to 15 years, is going to become unfeasible everywhere. The world is going to drift in the direction of more cultural identity, more national distinction, and more opposition to immigration. And I don't want to have the legitimate, law-abiding parties be stubborn about this and sit by while these new-age fascists come in and lead the way on this issue. We need to respond to the reality of people's experiences.
