This is a copy of a Tumblr post I made, showing how I draw all the assets and put them together to make the frames in my videos.

I draw all the lines with a mouse and pencil tool because I like the messy, hard-line style of the resulting images. I do a lot of it in MSpaint and then I use GIMP a few things that are tricky to do, like adding the window pane effect.

You don't need another program to combine assets like this. Just make the background a colour you aren't using (this can be white, but that means you can't also use white as part of your drawing), set that your background colour in paint, and mark the selection and transparent.

Then to make shadows, you could manually shift the colours darker (I used to do this) (or for the window pane, make it a bit lighter and rotate the hue toward cyan), but itâ€™s easier to add a layer on top in another program and lower its opacity.
