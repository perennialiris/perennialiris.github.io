2025-04-22 | **India, Pakistan** --- A deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir (the disputed region that is nominally independent but effectively split between India and Pakistan) has triggered conflict between India and Pakistan. The attack took place in Pahalgam, a town in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, and killed 26 civilian tourists.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/attack-tourists-indian-kashmir-kills-26-people-injures-17-police-say-2025-04-23/)[](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl/) The Indian Armed Forces blamed an Islamic terrorist group called [The Resistance Front (TRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_Front), one of several organizations like it dedicated to conquering Kashmir for Pakistan. In response, India launched missiles into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and later into Pakistan itself (2025-05-07), saying it was targetting terrorist organizations. Pakistan alleged they were targeting civilian areas, including mosques, and retaliated. Things escalated back and forth until both nation's militaries were striking each other, causing international concern and US involvement. A ceasefire was reported on 2025-05-10.

2025-06-12 | Israel launches dozens of preëmptive strikes against Iran, targetting military instalments and nuclear facilities. An Israeli military official said Iran was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons within days, meaning the attack was urgent and couldn't be delayed any longer.

In addition to launching air strikes, the Mossad (Israel's intelligence agency) has activated various covert operations inside Iran. The United States reportedly had no involvement.[](https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=122776202)[](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-strikes-iran-what-we-know-so-far)[](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-it-strikes-iran-amid-nuclear-tensions-2025-06-13/)

Trump: "Well, if they do coöperate, that's good---if they don't, it's not going to matter to us at all. You know who wants to help us? Police department.
