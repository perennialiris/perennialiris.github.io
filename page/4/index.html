# Sex, gender, & transsexuals

.2024-11-19

This is an informational post intended to help people better navigate the sometimes-confusing dialogue surrounding sex, gender, and transsexuals. I made it because I find even well-meaning people with progressive attitudes often get basic information about these topics wrong, starting all the way down from fundamental questions like the very meaning of sex and gender.

# Pt. I: Sex

Sex is a *model* we've come up with to classify organisms by **the role they play in sexual reproduction**, where *sexual reproduction* means the fusion of gametes. Gametes are cells that come together to a new organism. With this in mind, nearly all species can be interpreted as one of three categories:

* **asexual**, meaning they don't reproduce sexually at all;
* **dioecious** (die-ee-shiss), meaning they have some kind of male--female distinction;
* **monoecious** (moh-nee-shiss), also known as hermaphroditic, meaning they don't have a strict male--female organism distinction.

Nearly all individual organisms can then be interpreted as one of four categories:

* **male** or **female**, the complementary roles in most sexual reproduction;
* **hermaphrodite**, meaning an organism that fulfils both the male and female function, either simultaneously or at different points in its life (there are different sub-types of hermaphrodite);
* or **asexual**, meaning a member of a species that doesn't have this distinction.

In some species, sexual reproduction is more complicated, and as a result you'd need more than two categories in order to model the roles of its member organisms. This is very rare and limited to things like algae, fungi, slime moulds, and microscopic organisms like ciliates. In many cases there are multiple different types of a thing, and any pair can come together to reproduce so long as they're not the same type. In some cases, reproduction may require more than two participants, including a group of things coming together like the pieces of Exodia. Though fascinating, keep in mind this is a tiny category of strange exceptions, and that no birds or mammals work anything like this.

If you're a human, then your body probably has a type of cell called a **gamete**: either a small gamete (sperm), which your body produces regularly, or a large gamete (egg, or ovum, plural ova), which your body has a finite store of and is slowly releasing throughout your life until depleted. Through sexual intercourse, sperm enters into an ovum, fusing together to create a zygote, the beginning of a new human.

If you're a sperm-producing human, we'd categorize you as a male, because the way that you'd pass on genetic material to your offspring is through the production of small gametes. If you're an egg-bearing human, we'd categorize you as a female, because the way that you would pass on genetic material to your offspring is by the production of large gametes. That's what all this sex business boils down to.

I sometimes hear people say **sex is a spectrum**, or make the related claim that **sex is bimodal**. This is erroneous and not what any real scientific sources claim. It likely stems from a mistake about *what sex actually refers to*. There are various traits that correlate with sex, such as hormone levels, body hair, height, or bone structure, where if you take measures from every person in society, you could end up with what resembles a spectrum with a bimodal distribution. But sex itself is not like this, because none of these traits are sex.

For all intents and purposes, sex in humans is a binary classification, *as it's intended to be*. We consider all humans to be one or the other. Even when we're discussing other species that could have more than two sex designations, sex as a concept deals in discrete categories. If you're trying to describe something more complex and variable, like the social behaviour of an organism, then sex isn't the term you're looking for.

This isn't my opinion about what sex *ought* to mean. I don't care how words are used in the grand scheme of things. I'm very 'descriptivist' when it comes to language. I'm just observing how the word is, in fact, used. I consulted many different sources about how sex is used in academia, and what I found is not a divide or debate, but an obvious, overwhelming consensus. I'll include a few random citations from a variety of sources:

||indent
"Sex: either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions"
--- Oxford dictionary, 2011

||indent
"An individual organism's biological sex relies upon the definition of sex organs (ovaries or testes) and the types of gametes (reproductive cells) they produce --- either eggs or sperm. ... Sex is a biological construct, used as a binary descriptor of biological maleness or femaleness." (p.19)
"In sexually reproducing animals, there are two sexes, the male and the female. ... Whereas a social analysis of sexuality and gender might construct a very different view, the message from biological analysis is that sexually reproducing species constitute a binary system of male and female (although individuals in some species can manifest both sexes as hermaphrodites). ... Simply put, an individual animal is a male if the sex organs are testes, which produce sperm. ... An individual animal is female if the sex organs are ovaries, which produce eggs." (p.43)
--- The Biology of Sex, by Alex Mills (2018)

||indent
"There is an agreement by convention: individuals producing the smaller of the two gamete types --- sperm or pollen --- are males, and those producing larger gametes --- eggs or ovules --- are females."
--- The Evolution of Parental Care, 2012

If your opinion is that the word *should* be redefined to mean something else, that's not an invalid opinion to have and somebody could make a prescriptive case for that. However, at the time of writing, that change has yet to happen, so for now, sex means as described above.

.The book *The Biology of Sex* by Alex Mills is a great modern resource about sex that I'd recommend you consult about any of this if you want more information and have access to it.

## What about a sterile person?

Though true in essence, what I wrote about sex above isn't *comprehensive*. It's more of a starting point. If I define a male and female simply as sperm-producing and egg-bearing, respectively, then what about a sterile male who doesn't produce sperm? We could also ask about a child, or an 80-year-old who no longer has any sexual function, or a woman who's had a hysterectomy. The point is, what about a person who lacks their primary sexual function?

What is a definition? It's what a word means, but there's more to it: what it means for a word to mean something is for that thing to be what real people intend when they use the word. A definition is therefore a functional description of the bounds of the intended referent of the word being defined. This is sometimes a work in process.

If I were making the world's first dictionary and I had to define the word 'vehicle', I might say it's a thing used to get around, like a bus or car---because when people make that noise out of their mouth, that's what they have in mind. But what about a bicycle? Is a bicycle a vehicle? I don't think people consider it one, so we can't just say it's a thing used to get around. What if I said it's a thing used to get around that requires fuel? That might work. But what about a horse? Or a train? Wait, do people consider trains vehicles? I'm actually not sure. And then what happens in the future, if people change their mind and now they do consider bicycles vehicles?

Even what feels like a simple concept that we use all the time without having to stop and think about it that much can unfold into something complex if you try and comprehensively define the boundaries of what does and does not qualify. But notice that throughout this process, what we're doing every step of the way is asking not what *should* be a vehicle, but what people *consider* vehicles. That's the job of a lexicographer, chasing after the ever-changing reality of what real people mean when they say words. Definitions are observed.

Let's imagine I have a large collection of vehicles. I want to store them all in one of two different warehouses. I label one 'car storage' and the other 'boat storage'. I provide a working definition for both terms: a car is a thing that drives on land, a boat is a thing that floats at sea. What if I then found a boat that had a big hole in it? It can't float at sea. So is it no longer a boat? Are we just going to get confused about how to interpret this item and not know where to put it? Does the fact it's not a boat anymore mean it's a car?

It's obviously just a broken boat. It could've floated at sea, before something went wrong that prevented it from doing that function. But my first attempt at a definition didn't take exceptions like this into account. It would be like if I defined swans as white birds before making the discovery that black swans are a thing.

What happens when we stumble upon an exception that a previous definition didn't account for is that we update our definition to integrate it into our model---or we don't bother, depending on the necessary specificity of the context in which we're speaking. For the most part, I could probably still say that boats are things we use to float on water, and it's not actually going to cause any confusion, because people can do the one-step extrapolation on their own about how to interpret a boat with a big hole in it that doesn't float anymore. But if I wanted to be precise, I could write into my definition that a boat is a vehicle whose intention, design, or emergent purpose was or is to be propelled across the surface of water, or other water-like liquids without being submerged in said liquid and which is capable of serving as a means of travel for some kind of entity, typically a human, without being submerged in said liquid under normal operating conditions, and which has some kind of mechanism for propulsion other than being pulled along by the motion of the water itself, such as but not limited to oar, engine, or sail. And even this definition isn't perfect, but it's more comprehensive than 'a thing that we use to float at sea'.

If I first say a male is a sperm-producing organism and a female is an ova-bearing organism, most people don't even bother thinking about the exceptions where a person in actuality fulfils neither function, because they understand that an infertile or immature male would still just be interpreted as a male, as they have all the features that would lead to sperm production under normal circumstances or later in their life cycle. But if you *really* want to rules-lawyer me on this, a male is a human whose design or model is of the sperm-producing variety, while a female is a person whose design or model is of the ova-bearing variety, identified by the presence or absence of sexual development toward ovaries or testes.

When a human is in utero, meaning in the uterus of their mother before they're born, they have a gland called gonads, which develop into either testicles, which make sperm, or ovaries, which come with a set of undeveloped, dormant ova in the body that are gradually depleted through the ovary's process selection, maturation, and release, which for the sake of simplicity is sometimes called ova production (though the female body doesn't produce new ova in the same way the male body produces new sperm).

The question ultimately remains: if this organism were to pass on its genes, would it do so *as a male* or *as a female*? And if something were to get in the way of its development and prevent it from reproducing, then the question becomes: what if that hadn't happened? Then would it have engaged in reproduction as a male or as a female?

## Chromosomes

What determines whether your gonads develop into one or the other? This is where most people start talking about chromosomes, which can also be misleading. **Your sex is not your chromosomes.** Your sex is not defined as, nor does it boil down to, what chromosomes you have. Instead, your chromosomes---really, just one specific chromosome---is the thing that typically causes you to become one sex or the other. There's a big difference between a causal relationship, where P leads to Q or P gives rise to Q, and an identity relationship, where P is Q, or is defined as Q, or is an alias of Q.

**The biology:** A chromosome is a thread-like structure made up of DNA and proteins. These come in pairs for some reason, typically 23 pairs, or 46 individual strands, per cell nuclease. Why 23 pairs? I don't know. Why do you have 10 fingers? Why do you have 26 bones in your foot? It's just a number. So there's 23 pairs of these things, and one specific pair, usually shown as the very last, is called your sex chromosomes. The reason we call them your sex chromosomes is because under normal circumstances, they seem to be what causes, triggers, or induces sexualization. (In this context, 'sexualization' means "causing a thing to be distinguishable as male or female".)

The first chromosome in your sex chromosome pair is always what's called an X, while the other is either also an X, in which case the embryo probably develops into a female, or instead there's a Y chromosome, which has a special protein called an SRY gene (which literally just stands for "Sex-determining Region Y"), which probably causes the embryo to develop into a male. The reason I say probably is because this isn't *always* the case---it's only *normally* or *typically* the case (>99 percent), as opposed to it being so by definition (we don't need to say triangles "probably" have 3 sides).

Think about a person who has a male reproductive system, who's born with a penis, their body makes sperm, they can impregnate females---but, they have an XX sex chromosome pair, which is typically female. Is this person male or female? This question has a clear answer: they're male. This is what I mean when I say your sex isn't defined as nor does it boil down to your chromosomes. Your chromosomes being female-typical wouldn't override everything else about you and make you female. This would just be a male with a chromosomal abnormality.

In fact, there's a condition that causes exactly this, called *de la Chappelle syndrome*, or XX male syndrome, where a person with female sex chromosomes develops as a male for some reason, likely because they somehow got an SRY gene from somewhere other than a Y chromosome. The human body is so complex, so many things go wrong in our development, and there are so many people in the world to choose from, that strange variations are bound to happen in some number. And the point is, when they do, the final question of what sex a person is has never been their chromosomes. That just correlates with sex.

**A comparison:** Imagine we figure out some other trait, like being left-handed, or being gay, or having red hair, is caused by a simple gene. Let's say having red hair is called by having the RH gene. We assume these things are connected because every redhead we test has this gene, and none of the other people have it, so it seems like having this gene is what activates the red hair trait. What happens if tomorrow, we find a natural redhead whom we karyotype they *don't* have that gene? We might have an explanation for how this person's hair is red, and we might not. But what we wouldn't do is say this person doesn't *really* have red hair because they lack the thing that *normally causes* red hair. Nobody would say the definition of being a redhead is having the gene that causes it. Being a redhead means having red hair. We don't conflate the thing itself with the thing that *causes* the thing.

## Intersex people

Some people are what we call intersex. This is an unfortunate term that is misleading for some people, because it sounds like it means something that's between sexes, which suggests that it's some kind of third sex, or an alternative to male or female. There is a term in biology for an organism that performs both male and female functions: a hermaphrodite. And there's a term for an organism that's part of a species that doesn't have sexual reproduction: an asexual organism. Intersex people are not either of these things.

**Intersex people are still considered male or female.** The meaning of the term is somebody who has atypical sex characteristics, or as you could put it, they have characteristics that are in between what is typical for males and what is typical for females. An intersex male is a male who has atypical sex characteristics, and vice versa for intersex females.

For example, one of the most common intersex conditions is called Klinefelter syndrome. This is caused by a chromosomal abnormality, where instead of having two sex chromosomes, a person ends up with three, making them not XX or XY but XXY. However, that means they still have a Y chromosome, so they develop as males, but they experience various abnormalities, especially during puberty. This person is intersex, but speaking biologically they're still a male organism. If they were to reproduce, they would do so by passing on their genetic material via the small gamete they produce in their testicles.

In some very rare cases, a person with an intersex condition ends up with an especially atypical combination of traits that could lead a reasonable person to ask if we could justify conceptualizing a third sex designation to catch the exceptions, rare though they may be. Let's consider some examples:

* If a person has *complete androgen insensitivity syndrome*, or CAIS, their body may begin a process of masculinization as their gonads differentiate into testes, but they won't descend and instead their body develops a vagina with a mostly female phenotype. However, this person may have XY chromosomes, and lack a uterus. This person would be considered male, but is one of the most atypical males you could possibly come across.
* If a person has something called *XY gonadal dysgenesis*, or Swyer syndrome (<span class="nowrap">s'why-ur</span>, rhymes with buyer), their gonads, insteads of developing into testicles or ovaries, fail to develop one way or the other. Instead they'll develop female features including a vagina, but they'll be infertile, never develop ova, and never menstruate. This person has the DNA to become a male, but doesn't fully do so, and then starts developing as a female, but then doesn't fully do that either. So what are they?
* If a person has *ovotesticular disorder*, or a similar condition called *mixed gonadal dysgenesis*, they may end up with a combination of testicular and ovarian tissue, and may also have ambiguous genitalia (partially a vagina and partially a penis, due to sexualization not completing in a typical way). There has never been a case of a person like this who is capable of both male and female reproductive function, but the classification of such a person is still awkward due to their combination of features, and people both with and without Y chromosomes have been grouped in here, but it's also such a rare disorder that very little is really known about it.

In cases like these, you may be tempted to say the sex of the person being described should be either both or neither, but we don't really have those as an option in our model, because humans aren't an asexual species, and there have never been any known cases of hermaphroditism in humans (it seems to simply not occur in our species). The people with Swyer syndrome or CAIS are males, and it sounds like most cases of people with an ovotesticular disorder were males too, but the most ambiguous case imaginable is still not going to render a 'both' or 'neither', but a "we don't know". If this person were to reproduce, would they do so by passing on small gametes or large gametes? In some cases the answer might end up being that we're unable to discern how a person would've developed if they hadn't had a developmental abnormality, and as such we're not sure whether they would've been a male or female organism. In principle, it's the same answer you'd come to if you asked scientists what sex a zygote is the moment after it's fertilized.

However, for the sake of discussion and understanding, let's suppose that's not the case. Suppose instead I agree and say people like this aren't compatible with a binary model of sex and the solution is to have a third category for people who are especially ambiguous. The result would not be a spectrum, nor sex being bimodal. It would still force a binary for 99.99999 percent of people, but with a tiny third category for some extremely rare exceptions. This would still be discrete options, just three instead of two. In that case, we might call sex a ternary, or trinary, or trinity, rather than a binary---but not a spectrum, and not bimodal.

## Sex characteristics and phenotype

Sex itself isn't the most important quality. Often what actually matters when we look at and interact with other people is not sex itself, but the various things that correlate or arise downstream from sex. These things are called **sex characteristics**, a term for anything that tends to differ between sexes. This can be broken down further into primary sex characteristics (things like that are directly related to reproduction, like the penis or uterus) and secondary sex characteristics, which are not (e.g. females having larger breasts, males having more facial hair, females having wider hips). This is also how we categorize things like the males of many bird species being more colourful than their females, or male lions having more prominent manes, or a simple difference like female bears being significantly smaller than male ones.

A related term is **phenotype**, which is often contrasted with **genotype**. These are general terms that refer to your genes (genotype), and the observable characteristics that result from genes (phenotype). When it comes to the conversation about sex, technically it's more your phenotype, or rather a specific part of your phenotype (your gonads and their function), that define what your sex is. However, the phenotype of a person also refers to many other features that are not part of your sex. For example, what your face looks like is part of your phenotype.

# Pt. II: Gender

By the mid 1900s, beginning in the 60s but remaining on the fringes til gaining more steam in the 90s, writers in various fields converged in wanting to distinguish between the underlying biology of sex and its related characteristics on the one hand, and the way that these biological differences play out socially or in cultures on the other.

We might say, for example, that in a given society, men are expected to pay the bill if he goes to a restaurant with a woman, but is this a sexual difference? Is that part of their sex? No, it's clearly something else, but something that arises downstream, as a result of their sex. But because we're pattern-seeking machines, and virtually every person in society is clearly male or female, we tend to form generalizations about these differences. The resulting phenomenon didn't have a proper name, so they gave one, and the name they chose was gender. This is now largely how the term is used today.

Gender is far from the only instance where we draw a distinction between an underlying, concrete, or base reality, and the more imaginary, conceptual, or abstract idea that our experience of the concrete gives rise to. Consider fathers and fatherhood, leaders and leadership, professions and professionalism. In each case, the concept wouldn't exist without the underlying reality, but once established, they can be spoken of, thought of, and even exist independently from their origin. A person can exhibit fatherhood without technically being a father. A person can act professionally outside the scope of their job, and so on.

It doesn't take much for us to recognize patterns, and patterns that affect social organization can create a feedback loop, or compound upon itself, or become self-reinforcing. If all the girls at a school play basketball and all the boys play baseball, that likely influences what sport a new student at the school is going to play, because for various reasons, people like the environments where they feel like they fit in. They're going to look at the baseball team, look at the basketball team, and the girls are going to go where the girls are and the boys are going to go where the boys are. People self-select for where they feel most welcome, and we have a desire to meet perceived social expectations.

Now think about how that might apply to ancient human tribes. Just the fact women get pregnant and men don't could alone result in their occupying different social roles, and once that norm is in place, people will select for it. The most socially successful men will be the ones who the boys of the next generation look up to, and vice versa, girls and women. The elders teach the young, the young try to emulate the elders. **Once a division like this *gets* going, it keeps going.** Then you realize it's not just pregnancy. Females are smaller, shorter, weaker, more vulnerable, they have a different psychology, different personalities, they hit puberty earlier, they seem to be more interested in social or interpersonal labour, they occupy roles within family structures. They're different all over, in so many different ways. There's no way that any society isn't going to notice all of these differences and carve out different ideals in their head for what males tend to be like and what females tend to be like, which is essentially all gender is, when half your society clearly fits one pattern and the other half clearly fits the other.

Societies do also differ in their specific gendered ideas. Perhaps in one place wearing earrings is masculine, while in another society they're feminine. Maybe in one place wearing red is masculine, while in another place wearing red is gender neutral. Maybe 200 years later, it had become a feminine thing. These little details all shift around depending on the time and place, but also overlap in broader themes, because the social development of all these different societies have what are essentially the same starting point: the average biological differences between males and females. It's like different streams that are branching off from the same riverheader---there's just some baseline facts that are true in every society, so we're all forming generalizations and coming up with cultural trends based in similar experiences and observations, even if the more granular things can differ.

## History of terms

The discourse about gender originally focused on social roles or gender as a category of association, the idea that some things are for girls and some things are for boys. This led to derivative terms like gender identity, roles, presentation, and more, which can cause confusion because now two people can both say the word 'gender' without qualification, and they're unknowingly talking about different things.

Language like this began appearing in American psychiatric literature in the 1950s, albeit the meaning has shifted since then. The term *roles* was used at the time to capture the social phenomenon, while the term *identity*, or core gender identity, was used for the persistent internal or private experience of that social phenomenon. They also talked about sexual identity, i.e. your sexuality, which was another piece of a person's broader social identity, i.e. the way in which a person is self-aware of how they fit into their society. Today people use a multitude of terms, like gender performance, gender expression, or gender presentation, to describe the ways in which a person actualizes a certain gender role---any behaviour, attitude, or appearance associated with a person depending on if they're perceived as a man or woman.

We may then combine this with a description of sex and phenotype to create a thorough report of a person's place in a given social situation: a person may have a male genotype, a female phenotype, a male gender identity, but attend dinner with their grandparents where they adopt a female gender expression. However, for the vast majority of people this is all unnecessary because these things will align (male genotype, male phenotype, male identity, male expression, or vice versa).

If a person uses the term 'gender', it's their responsibility to ensure the context is understood via some type of qualification; but if no qualification is given, then it becomes your responsibility as a listener to figure out what is actually being spoken of, because 'gender' can be the first half of a number of different terms for different concepts, and the truth of a statement about gender can vary depending on what sense of the word is actually under examination.

A great example of this is the statement "gender is a social construct".

## Is gender a social construct?

This phrase has become less commonplace, but in, say, 2013, it was something any person who used the internet regularly heard in someplace or another: gender is a social construct. What does this mean, and why does it matter? The claim gets a lot of mileage for something most people don't seem able to explain if you ask them, and I'm doubtful of how many people know why it matters either.

"Gender is a social construct" became a progressive canard, something people said out of habit, an utterance whose main purpose was not to convey any specific meaning but to indicate to others which side of the issue I aligned with. It reminds me of a modern joke about how during any meeting at work you can, without even listening or paying attention to the conversation, interject with "it's all about finding the right balance", and people will nod in agreement as though you've said something meaningful.

And on the other side of the issue, people realized that progressives kept calling things social constructs, and therefore felt obliged to disagree, before they were even sure what they were disagreeing with.

**A social construct is anything that is so only because we've all agreed that it is.** A good example of a social construct is the meaning of words. The fact a rock is hard or sinks into water isn't a social construct; it's a truth about the natural world that we observe. But why does the word 'rock' refer to this object, or with any given meaning? There is no truth of the universe to that association. We just needed a noise and some symbols to refer to this thing, and 'rock' is what we came up with and agreed to. It's only 'true' by convention (or by observation of that which has been agreed to by others).

We could go on to say any other aspect of language is socially constructed, from the words to the spelling and grammar. Another common example is law. What makes something legal or illegal? The universe itself has not given this to us as observable knowledge---the truth is up to us. If every human in the world decided that something was illegal, then it would be. That's the 'magic' of social constructs: the truth is whatever we (as a society) decide it to be. We are the truth makers.

Some other examples: morality, good manners, what year it currently is, when the weekend starts.

**Is that the same as it being subjective?** It may sound similar, and the two often overlap, but no. A quality being subjective or objective is a matter of whether it's a property of the object or if it's something that arises or takes form only via the relationship between object and subject ('subject' meaning the outside entity that is observing or otherwise interacting with the object). The most common example of a subjective quality is beauty. What makes a thing beautiful, if not that there is some kind of observer who considers it beautiful? And if nobody considers a thing beautiful, then how can it be said to have beauty? What else does 'having beauty' mean? Not all qualities are like this.

A different example that may be more helpful here is the taste of food. Why does honey taste good? I don't know. It just does. Another person might disagree, however, and say honey tastes terrible. Whether honey tastes good is subjective, because tasting good requires a taster to evaluate it as good-tasting. It's possible that a space-alien species that visits Earth tomorrow tries honey and to their tongues, it tastes disgusting, and from their perspective we're all crazy for enjoying it. But the taste of honey isn't socially constructed, because I don't only think it's good because my society has decided that it is, or developed that as a convention and taught me that I'm supposed to like it. My enjoyment of it is independent of any social influence.

(It may be possible for some aesthetic preferences to be like this, not in whole but in part. If a whole society tells itself that a certain thing is supposed to be enjoyable, could they induce an enjoyment for that thing? Possibly. For example, some people argue that how we feel about popular music is socially induced to a degree, and our idea of what music is 'good' is going to be different depending on what society we grow up in. There are also some aspects of music theory that seem to be natural and don't need to be taught or induced. There is probably very interesting discourse to be had on this topic. However, this is clearly not what happened with honey.)

If I were to say gender is socially constructed, what I probably mean by that is to say gender roles entail socially-constructed associations. To wear a perfume that smells like flowers---is this masculine or feminine? It depends on the society. Maybe it's a unisex thing everybody does. Some aspects of gender as a social phenomenon are socially constructed. There are some qualities that feel as though they get closer to objective observation rather than frivolous cultural fodder like food or clothing, such as the association between men and violence, bravery, physical strength, risk-taking. It's not beyond imagination that a society could think women are more violent and men are more peaceful, but I don't think there has ever been such a thing, because it goes pretty directly against the reality created by hormonal differences.

At this point, some people have the intuition that some aspect of our gendered associations, the base or foundation perhaps, are not social constructions but instead an underlying reality that we're tapping into. This isn't quite right: a convention that forms based on some kind of observation is still a convention. However, in that world, it would still be so that we socially construct many things atop that foundation, leading to a granted area of agreement where we can say things like which colours are for girls and which colours are for boys is socially constructed. This also indicates that such associations are clearly *malleable*, because we all know and acknowledge that such associations change over time.

But this is using 'gender' to mean gendered associations. What about gender identity? That's a funny question. What would it even mean for a personal identity to be socially constructed? I assume what a person means by this phrase is that how a person's identity formed was influenced by social factors. In other words, it's not actually about socially constructed ideas, but an instance of another long-standing topic of debate within biology and sociology known as **nature versus nurture**. This means trying to determine the extent to which a given thing is caused by genes (nature) or caused by the conditioning that you experience growing up, interacting with other people or other physical aspects of your environment (nurture). Let's say we notice girls cry more than boys. Why is that? Is it nature or nurture? It could be something innate, like a hormonal difference, but it could also be that we teach boys growing up that crying isn't okay, while we don't discourage it as much in girls, thus *creating* that difference through nurture? Then again, it could be a combination of both. But if so, then which factor is greater? Is it equal? Is it 20 percent nature and 80 percent nurture? This is the kind of thing people disagree on for many observable differences between people.

Not many things result entirely from nature without any influence by nurture. An example is your blood type, which is unchanging after being genetically determined. Some things result entirely from nurture, like what language you speak. There is no natural language that comes pre-built into your brain. It's something you learn from other people around you, and if you had been born into a different part of the world, you'd likely know different languages. But many things are influenced by both. When it comes to your personal, core gender identity, is that determined by nature or nurture? It could be influenced by socialization to some extent, but today we believe it's mostly a matter of nature. However, as recently in time as the 1970s, there were people who supposed core gender identity was determined entirely or nearly entirely by nurture, or, to use the term they used at the time, by rearing.

In the 1960s, a researcher named John Money saw an opportunity to test and hopefully demonstrate this hypothesis when a baby, at an age of 1 year and 10 months, had somehow lost most of its penis in an accident. Money somehow convinced the parents to let Money give the child cross-sex hormone treatments and raise him as a girl. Money thought if you raise a child as a girl, the child will accept that role and go along with it, because in Money's view core gender identity was determined by socialization, and with this child he hoped to prove it. And for some time, people thought he did, but later Money came to be seen as having lied about the results of the experiment by hiding details of what happened to the boy, yet referring to it as a success story and as proof of how malleable gender identity supposedly was.

In actuality, it went very badly. For one, Money was accused of grossly mistreating this child during his upbringing, until the child eventually rejected what they had been taught and went back to living as a boy by the time he was 14. The experience was traumatizing, not only for the confusion but for the strict treatment the boy endured, along with his twin brother, whom Money also got to work with. He not only saw and worked with both boys naked, but instructed them to pretend to be acting out sex acts with one another, supposedly to enforce to the main boy that he was supposed to be in a woman's role, which Money claimed was part of how the child would learn their new identity.

Later in his career, John Money went on to say he didn't think pedophilia was necessarily harmful, writing in 1991, among other instances, that a 10-year-old boy could have a sex relationship with a man in his 30s and that would not be pathological. This coming after his unethical experiment that he lied about, John Money became a controversial figure and is now remembered almost exclusively in a negative light. He passed away in 2006.

I have no interest in trying to rescue Money's legacy or reputation, which are deservedly negative. However, in the interest of accuracy, I'll clarify a few things:

* John Money wasn't a pedophile. There's no evidence that he was one. If he had been a pedophile, it sounds like he was in a position where he could've easily sexually abused the children he had access to, yet decades later he had never been accused of that. It seems safe to say he wasn't one. He did work with naked children, but so do many other medical professionals whom you don't consider pedophiles.
* Let's not overstate our condemnation: Money was a researcher who did some aggressively unethical things in effort to prove himself right. Sadly, this happens sometimes with scientists and other intellectuals, which is why they need oversight and ethics rules.
* Decades ago, when you were dealing with a vulnerable group of people who were generally looked down upon, you could get away with a lot more than usual, and far more than now. There is likely a great amount of abuse in the history of study of gender and related topics.
* John Money isn't, like, "the founder of gender theory" or anything like that. Nor is he somebody to whom modern progressives owe their beliefs. John Money's beliefs were directly at odds with what is believed today, because **if children simply accepted whatever gender identity was given to them by their upbringing, then how could trans people exist?** The failure of Money's experiment is, if anything, a confirmation of the modern position. Trans people can't just be conditioned or willed out of being trans, just like the boy that Money experimented on couldn't be conditioned out of his being a boy. However, **anti-transgender figures to this day love to bring up John Money** and talk about him as though his sins discredit modern beliefs about gender or trans people. This is the main reason most people ever even hear about him.
* Even if John Money had been the first person to propose every facet of modern beliefs about gender, got all of it correct, and then ran around being a racist pedophile serial killer who loved torture and cannibalism, that would all be irrelevant to the accuracy or inaccuracy of his findings. If Einstein were a bad person, would that make relativity any less true? The type of argument people are making when they attack Money in this way is called a genetic fallacy or fallacy of origins, whereby an idea is evaluated not by its merit, but how we feel about where it came from.

## Why does it matter?

I asked this earlier. Let's get back to it.

At best, the notion gender is a social construct is offered in reply to somebody who's speaking of gendered associations as though they're timeless, or something that can or should never change. It can sometimes be useful to point out or remind people of the fact humans are in control of these standards, not the way around, and we know our standards can change and have changed in the past. However, there are also many conversations in which that isn't a relevant thing to say, and people blurt it out anyway. The message becomes unclear, unless the intention is, as it seems, to say "this thing is a social construct, therefore it doesn't matter or is unimportant, because it's *just* a social construct".

A more focused response in that context may be to say that our standards are demonstrably malleable. A malleable thing is one we can change or alter over time without breaking. We understand that laws are malleable, and that language is malleable. We understand that fashion changes. So do gendered associations. There's no reason to bring the language of social construction into the mix. It doesn't add anything to the discourse, and is often confusing.

# Pt. III: Transsexuals

There has always been some disagreement about how precisely to define a transsexual person. A simple description is that a transsexual person is a male who identifies with and wants to live in a way that's more consistent with females, or a female who identifies with and wants to live in a way that's more consistent with males, in their respective cultures.

Let's consider the history of terms:

* The term **transsexual** came to English in the 1940s, derived from the equivalent German "transsexualismus", used in 1923 by German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld.
* **Gender** in its modern sense first emerged in the mid 1900s, but became more popular in the 1970s, and then again in the 2010s, or something like that.
* **Transgender** was first used in the 1960s, intended to be an alternate term for the same phenomenon as 'transsexual'. It was introduced by psychiatrist J. F. Oliven, who said 'transsexual' was misleading because it made people think it was describing something sexual in nature, like 'homosexual'.
* **Cisgender** first emerged in the 1990s to describe the non-trans population, simply by taking the existing *cis-* prefix, the opposite of *trans-* in various contexts.

*Magnus Hirschfeld should probably be regarded as one of the great heroes of queer history. In addition to his well-meaning work with transsexuals, he wrote about homosexual love and racism. For his work, he was assaulted and exiled from his country by the Nazis. Their paramilitary groups also destroyed his research facility and burned his library in 1933.*

## Transsexual vs. transgender

Why are there two different terms that mean roughly the same thing? Today, some trans people reject the transsexual label, and some trans people reject the transgender label. Many other people consider the two synonyms, or view transsexual as the outdated, legacy term for transgender. Other people may consider transsexual to be a subset of transgender, with different meanings. I often shorten it to 'trans' in order to sidestep this entire dispute, but it's interesting enough to review.

The term transsexual came first, and then in the 1960s people started saying transgender, which really caught on by the 80s. Christine Jorgenson, one of the most famous transsexuals, probably the first 'celebrity' trans woman in the US, famously rejected the transsexual label, then in vogue, and insisted on being called transgender instead. She, too, cited her rationale as being that 'transsexual' sounded like it meant something to do with her sexuality, so that seems to have been what led to change broadly, as the country was then still divided on its view of homosexuals.

The term transsexual didn't fully disappear, however. It just became less popular, and then later back into some popularity, like a fashion trend coming full circle. But the reason, in both cases, was more than a random trend. In the last couple decades, the meaning of transgender was expanded to include more than it originally did, becoming an umbrella term for a set of people that's mostly transsexuals, but also some other people, who would probably claim to be trans, but not transsexuals. This left transsexual as the obvious choice to communicate that distinction, if you so desire.

This is what I'm signalling when I refer to myself as a transsexual. I'm transgender, but unlike some people, I'm also transsexual. I'm using it as a more specific designation. The people who consider theirselves transgender but not transsexual are, generally speaking, people who say they identify with the other gender, but don't actually transition their body or identify with the other sex. They might refer to theirselves as nonbinary, agender, or something else. There have been various proposed umbrella terms for these people (an umbrella *within* the larger transgender umbrella), such as gender-nonconforming, gender-queer, gender-variant, or gender-diverse.

There is sometimes conflict or tension between these two groups (transsexuals and non-transsexual transgender persons). In using a more specific term that communicates which subgroup I'm a part of, my intention is clarity and specificity, not to denounce or exclude anybody else. It's important to me that society protect the rights of gender-diverse expression. I would never choose to live in a place where a bearded lady doesn't feel safe in public.

## Why are people trans?

The short answer is nobody is sure. It's one of the many little quirks of nature, like how some people are gay, or left-handed, or psychopaths, or enjoy cilantro, or only have nine fingers. But unlike some of those other things, it's still a mystery what exact mechanism induces the quality of being trans. There are proposed hypotheses, but the truth of the matter is **not yet settled**. For now, we can just accept that every new generation of people is going to have some transsexuals in the mix. It's been estimated to affect roughly one in every 200 to 300 people, or in other words something like 0.3 to 0.5 percent. It could be more or less. (I'd personally argue those early estimates now seem to be slightly too high and the actual figure is more like 0.1 to 0.2 percent, but it's difficult to know any of this for sure.)

A trans person is born into society with no knowledge they're trans. They're raised in a gender-based social order where some people are boys and some people are girls, and depending on which you are, you're treated differently growing up, and then sorted into different rooms for some reason. At some point, that person may become self-aware and realize they're a girl but they really wish they could be a boy, or the other way around, and it's more than just a passing thought; it's a complex, a kind of obsession, something they can't easily get over or stop thinking about, because it's coming from a deep, fundamental part of theirselves. The question then shifts to how they want to navigate that situation.

In a sense, the 'trans agenda' is a proposal made by trans people to their community. "I'm not a male. I'm female. I was born female, and I was raised as a girl. However, my intention is to live as a man from now on. I'd like it if you could think of me like a male, treat me the way you treat males, and refer to me using male-coded language." And think of it the other way around for people born male. Importantly, this doesn't require disputing any of the facts about biology presented earlier in this document. Trans people don't have to claim or believe anything about theirselves that isn't uncontroversially true.

The language that we use for a trans person actualizing their identity is '**transitioning**'---either a female who transitions from living as a woman to instead living as a man, or a male who transitions from living as a man to instead living as a woman. Transsexual women are males living as woman, while transsexual men are females living as men.

Note at this point that it's become common to use **man and woman for gender**, but **male and female for sex**. This isn't always the case, and hasn't always been the case, but if we agree on a common distinction like this, it prevents having to clarify each time in the future. As such, I use this distinction in this document and in most of my other writings.

## Are trans people mentally ill?

If you're willing to respect the conclusion of modern psychiatrists, the simple answer is no, it's not considered a mental illness. It was *sort of* considered one in the past, when the condition was less well understood. Trans people typically had a lot of distress and confusion, high rates of other disorders, and their insistence on their own identity could be interpreted as some kind of irrational compulsion, so they'd go in to see medical professionals who would say "well *something* seems to be wrong with this person", and they tentatively threw us in the "mental disorder of some kind" bucket, where we stayed for a few decades until enough researchers decided to investigate the matter more.

**What *is* a mental illness, or disorder?** It's something that causes significant impairment to your ability to live your life in a normal, healthy, functional way. It's possible for you to experience a certain symptom but not so severely that it interferes with your ability to, let's say, have a job, go to school, maintain friends, family, a relationship, etc. If there can be people who lead normal, healthy lives while being trans, then 'being trans' is not itself a mental illness.

The belief that trans people are mentally ill---many people seem to think they're mentally ill *by definition*---comes from misunderstandings about 'gender dysphoria', a term listed in the DSM-5 that people interpret as a renaming of an older term, "gender identity disorder". If you look up that name change, you'll find sites claiming it was only renamed to help spare trans people's feelings, because the term 'disorder' was too stigmatizing---*not* because calling it a disorder was technically inaccurate. The impression people walk away with is that trans people have gender dysphoria, which is essentially still a mental disorder, so it's fair to just say trans people are mentally ill.

However:

* The shift from "gender identity disorder" to "gender dysphoria" was not just a renaming, but also a reconceptualization of what it is we're even talking about. It shouldn't even really be thought of as the same disorder under a new name, but a new disorder that better explains similar real cases, rendering the previously conceptualized disorder obsolete. We went from talking about the identity itself and calling that a disorder, to talking about the experience of distress or discomfort that arises from the divergence between a person's identity and the social expectations they experience in their society.
* Being trans doesn't just mean having gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria refers to something trans people often experience (distress or discomfort that arises from the incongruity between their identity and the social expectations they face in society), but not something that all trans people experience at all times, and which some trans people no longer actively experience after transitioning (which is why some people refer to transitioning, or the social actualization of gender identity, as the 'treatment' for dysphoria).
* There's a colloquial mix-up between gender dysphoria as a general experience versus gender dysphoria as a clinical diagnosis. This is similar to people who say they feel anxiety about something compared with people who have an anxiety disorder. Trans people may describe "feeling dysphoric" or "feeling dysphoria", but they aren't really describing having those feelings in a way that is so significant they would be classified as a mental illness. To make that distinction, some people have adopted the more specific term **clinical gender dysphoria**, while gender dysphoria without qualification can also include a general feeling that doesn't necessarily rise to the level of a disorder.

Even if trans people were necessarily mentally ill---as in, if 'being trans' was considered a mental illness---this likely wouldn't accomplish anything for the people who are most interested in the distinction. The purpose of claiming trans people are mentally ill is to imply that we should doubt the validity of their identity or experiences. That could make sense if you consider how, in many other cases, people who experience mental illness are likely to exhibit *cognitive distortions*, which can affect their judgment or reasoning. However, that doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to gender dysphoria or with identifying as a trans person. The trans people who claim to identify differently from the gender of their sex go on to live as the opposite gender and this does make them happy. There doesn't seem to be any real mistake in their reasoning or perception of the world.

A similar claim I sometimes see is that if somebody is mentally ill and claims something that isn't true---e.g. you're a schizophrenic and you think the government is watching you while you sleep---then we shouldn't affirm that delusion. The problem (aside from that I'm not certain we should never affirm the delusions of a crazy person---what if that *is* the right thing to do sometimes?) is that unlike a person who's hallucinating or experiencing a delusion of causality, trans people don't claim anything about the world that isn't factually true. This is itself contentious and leads to the next point.

## Are trans people delusional?

The people who dislike transgenderism and don't want it to be socially accepted sometimes claim that trans people hold a false belief, or deny some aspect of reality, by stubbornly asserting, perceiving, or believing in something that isn't true. This is called a **delusion**: a fixed belief that is held without justification and despite the presence of evidence that it's false. However, if you ask such people to identify the belief that is supposedly false, they immediately run into some problems.

**Answer 1:** "Trans people think they can change their sex."

This is a misconception that could, charitably, be blamed in part on the language of sex and its derivatives. The term 'transsexual' could sound like it means somebody whose sex changes, and transsexual people do get procedures that used to be called "sex change operations" (this term is outdated and no longer commonly used), and take what we still call cross-sex hormones. However, if we set aside these confusing labels and misnomers, **trans people don't believe or assert they're actually changing their sex**. Trans people understand they're able to change some aspects of their body, but not all aspects, and the amount of change possible with our current level of technology is not enough to justify saying the sex of any person has changed. Trans women haven't become biological females---a trans woman is a male who has feminized their body to some extent (they undergo *feminizing hormone therapy*), but they're still not able to get pregnant or have periods. They don't have female reproductive function. They can't pass on their genetic material through large gametes that fuse with the sperm of another person. And vice versa for trans men. There is no real confusion about any of this, except for the confusion that sometimes arises about what language is best to describe this reality.

**Answer 2:** "Trans women think they're women."

How can this be a delusion? If somebody says it's a delusion, they've failed to distinguish a factual dispute from a linguistic one. The latter is not categorically able to be a delusion, or even a false belief. As such, there must be a misunderstanding. Let's ensure we understand the difference.

* If I tell you this jar has 23 beans in it, but you disagree and say it only has 20, then we're having a factual dispute. There is some underlying fact of the matter, and we disagree about what that is. The reality may correspond with one of our claims, but not both, assuming our claims are contradictory. (We could also both be wrong.)
* If I tell you there's an elevator in the lobby, but you're from Britain so you call it a lift, then we're having a difference in language. We mean the same object, but we refer to this object using different names. There is no disagreement about the underlying reality we're both describing.
* If I ask you for chips, thinking of potato chips, but you're from Britain so you come back with what I'd call french fries, there is again a difference in language, but this time of a different nature: we're using the same name, but we had different objects in mind. So remember, it happens both ways.

A word is just a noise or series of symbols that directs us to a meaning. It's like a signpost, pointing to a location. The meaning is what matters. There *can* be interesting discussion about linguistic differences, as in asking why one way of wording something might be better or clearer than another---but linguistic differences *can't* be a 'delusion', because they aren't a matter of one's perception or understanding of reality. In other words, a linguistic difference is not evidence of a factual dispute.

Disagreements about the word 'woman' are a matter of people using the same term, but intending two different things. The comparison I often use is if I say there's a crane in the park, but you look in the park and don't see a crane, that may sound like a factual dispute at first, but if you realize that I was talking about a crane, the type of bird, and you were looking for a crane, those industrial lifting machines used to move heavy objects around, then we're actually not having a factual dispute at all. We're just experiencing a difference of language, but mistaking that for a factual disagreement.

I like to write out the different meanings as though separate entries in a dictionary:

||indent
**crane**
noun [ kreyn ]
**1:** the crane is a family of large, long-necked birds with sturdy bills and long, powerful legs.
**2:** a machine that uses a hoist and pulley to lift objects, typically during construction or to load and unload freight

This allows us to replay that interaction: I say there's a crane(1) in the park, but you look and say you don't see a crane(2) in the park. This time, there's clearly no conflict between our statements.

Now imagine woman is defined like this:

||indent
**woman**
noun [ wo͝omən ]
**1:** an adult human female
**2:** an adult human, usually a female, but not necessarily --- I'll expand more on this later

An anti-trans person claims that trans women aren't women(1), but trans women don't claim to be women(1). They only claim to be women(2). As such, there is no factual disagreement between the two statements, because the trans woman isn't claiming to meet the woman(1) criteria.

## What is a woman?

*Yes, that's the question the arguments in the previous section are naturally leading to.*

The concept of a woman came about to describe the general qualities of females, but now the proposal is that it doesn't need to be taken so strictly, and it's possible for a male to become part of what people *intend* when they say women, provided such males are sufficiently female-like, in some way or another (where *precisely* that line is drawn varies from person to person, so it's hard to nail down beyond this).

But why? What's the point in adopting a less rigid definition of 'woman'? This is an interesting point in the dialogue that many people never reach, instead getting stuck on one of the points before this. There is a natural shift in meaning that occurs when the intended referent changes, due to the language being pegged to something *other than* the qualities we actually care about or are meaning to select for. This is especially likely to happen when there are changing circumstances (e.g. the invention of hormone treatment and gender-affirming surgeries that make 'transsexual women' more of a realistic phenomenon for the rest of society to experience and integrate into their understanding of the world).

Think about a similar concept: fatherhood. To be a father in the biological sense means to be the male progenitor of another organism. From this point, though, we develop a *concept* of *fatherhood*, meaning the way fathers do or should behave in society or the type of relationship or commitment they do or should have to their offspring. It's then possible for a person to exhibit fatherhood toward a person without actually being their male biological progenitor. The concept derivative is able to exist independent from its concrete foundation.

Now suppose I live in a society where people have only recently started adopting children, as a new practice. I say to a class of children, if you don't know anything about hunting, you should ask your fathers to teach you, and two of the children raise their hand and say they don't have fathers---but I learn one of them is being raised by a man who adopted them, and the other is being raised by their mother along with another man whom their mother married after their father died. To clarify, I say that in their case, whenever I say 'father', they can just assume I mean those men instead, since for the purpose of what I'm talking about, it's not actually important for this person to be your biological progenitor. What's *actually* important is just that he's the man who's committed to raising and taking care of you.

Though imaginary, you can see how in this case, you can see how there's a divergence between the previous, literal definition of the language being used (father: male biological progenitor), and the idea that I was actually trying to capture, for which I merely used 'father' as a shorthand for lack of better term (father: the man who's raising you). But when an exception arose, I effectively *redirected* or *rerouted* that word from one meaning to the other by establishing my intention to the listener. It typically means one thing, but in this context, for you, take it to mean something else.

We may then develop language for this distinction, to be used whenever necessary. In this case: adoptive father vs. biological father. There are some circumstances where I need to specify one or the other, but there are many other cases where the distinction is unimportant and I can just use the unqualified unifying term 'father'.

This works out especially well in the father example because in many cases the distinction isn't apparent, i.e. you can't tell by looking. You've probably encountered people in your life whose father was not their biological progenitor and you didn't notice. In many cases, their children theirselves don't even notice. This isn't *necessary* for the linguistic rerouting, but it helps the transition happen more smoothly.

Now ask the question: ***Why* choose a less rigid definition of father?** To some degree the answer is we didn't directly choose it, so much as *it happened*, or that it comes about naturally under certain circumstances (a divergence between the intended and previous meaning of a word that's used as an approximation for some other, more important thing). The advantage conferred is *ease* or *convenience*. Instead of calling the adoptive father a father too, I could have always made the clarification "ask your father---or, if you don't have a father, then any male who is raising you *like* a father---to help you with this". But it's easier and more convenient to establish that "for our purposes here, that person counts as a father, so when I say 'father' in this context, he is included". We could say this person is an honorary father.

This analysis and rationale seems no less applicable to the concept of womanhood. Consider what I said earlier: the trans 'agenda' is a person making a proposal to their society to be treated *like* the sex they're not. Regardless of your personal attitude toward this phenomenon, the fact by this point is that in many communities, that proposal has been accepted. There are, in fact, biological males who are thought of, spoken of, and generally accepted as women, even by people who know full well they aren't females. The exact criteria varies, but suffice to say if a male expresses a persistent psychological desire to live as a woman and makes a significant change to their hair, clothing, behaviour, and body to be more female-like, then society at large, at least where I live, will accept this person as a woman, similar to the adoptive father being accepted as a father. I dare say they're honorary females.

Consider the effect this has on our language: if I tell all the women to go to one place, but my intention is not only for females but also for males who are thought of like females to go to that place, then I *could* specify that each time---or to make things easier, I could establish that, for my purposes in this context, when I say 'women', I mean both females and this special category of males that we treat like females. In this way, the language of 'woman' has been redirected or rerouted, to better match what is actually intended when it was first used.

**Trans women didn't *need* to be considered women.** 'Woman' is just a word, after all. I could imagine an alternate timeline where this linguistic shift never happened, where trans activists never said "trans women are women" and everybody in society insisted on a strict, unchanging definition for the term. What would be the fate of trans women? A person might ask me if trans women are women, and in that timeline I might reply "no, but we should treat them like women, even though they technically aren't". And what difference would that make? Aside from the words we use to describe it, not much. And remember, it's ultimately the treatment of people that is more important than the names we give them. We tend to care about language only because it often affects treatment, or it affects how people think, which affects treatment.

Why didn't that happen? Because it's weird and unnatural. It makes more sense that the language we're most used to would evolve. If I'm at a restaurant with a trans woman and I say to somebody "yeah I'm at the table with that man over there", pointing to somebody who looks like a female to everybody else, people are going to be confused. And nobody wants trans men who look like males in the female washrooms. Nor does anybody want to have to bother updating the way that we talk about gender in order to integrate these exceptions as clearly as possible. It makes more sense to integrate the exceptions into the language, by shrugging and saying "trans women are women and trans men are men". It's the simpler, more natural, more common-sense solution to the dilemma.

## Why did trans people become such a popular topic in the 2010s?

To many people this seems like a completely random cultural shift, like society got bored of its previous struggles and went out looking for some shiny new cultural thing to obsess over. That could be true to some extent, in a way that's less of a cynical conspiracy theory than it sounds, if some popular writers didn't have much to talk about and started paying more attention to issues they had previously overlooked to fill the attention vacuum---but I also don't really see anything to suggest that's the case. The shift was instead a consequence of systemic and institutional changes, *some of which* were resulted from research and understanding of trans people reaching a critical mass, where the opinion of establishment medical professionals was changed in response to accumulating evidence.

* In 2011, a major professional organization dedicated to research and treatment of trans people, known as the *Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association* (est. 1979), or HBIGDA, was renamed to the *World Professional Association for Transgender Health*, or WPATH. In the following year, it published version 7 of its *Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People*, often shortened to just the *Standards of Care*, or the SOC. A major change from the previous version published in 2001, version 7 finally discontinued the Benjamin Scale for diagnosing gender identity disorder.
Although progressive for its time, being developed by the well-meaning Harry Benjamin (another hero of queer history) as part of his 1966 book *The Transsexual Phenomenon*, the Benjamin Scale had become inconsistent with a modern understanding of gender identity, and, out of caution and an attempt to reduce liability for practitioners, it set much higher requirements for diagnosis than we have today.
The language and framing about transsexual, transgender, or gender-diverse people was also updated, stressing that such people are not necessarily disordered. This contributed to destigmatization, and led to transitioning being far more accessible for normal trans people.
* In 2013, the *American Psychiatric Association* (the APA) issued their fifth edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, often called the DSM. This update not only replaced gender identity disorder with gender dysphoria, but reframed how we even think about these things, from the identity itself being a disorder and a problem, to instead our goal being to address the anxiety or distress that such people experience, and *that* being the disorder. Like the WPATH changes, this contributed to destigmatization and helped increase accessibility of care.
* The emergence of social media was also a factor to increasing awareness of numerous social issues, including transgender identities, as it enabled dialogue that might've not happened otherwise, at least not nearly to the same extent. In 2005, nobody had a smartphone and there was no such thing as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok. A mere 7 years later, in 2012, all those websites had become mainstream (except TikTok, which took another 8 years or so).
There are still people who don't recognize how much of a change this was for our culture, because of how it enabled people all throughout society to access information and to connect and engage in conversation about anything they wanted in a pseudonymous manner. This was huge for minority voices, or anybody who would have been marginalized in the previous decades and had difficulty breaking through the more centralized landscape of mainstream legacy media.
The amount of discourse that took place focusing on race, gender, and sexuality suddenly exploded. It was a decade of freedom and self-expression that people who grew up before this time rarely had access to.
* Then, in and around 2015, there were major breakthroughs in mainstream cultural representation. This is when Caitlyn Jenner came out as transgender, probably the most high-profile person ever to do so. It shocked the world and sparked god knows how many conversations in how many households across America.
It was also in 2015 that *I am Jazz*, a reality television program spotlighting transgender teen Jazz Jennings, debuted on TLC with mainstream support, funding, and attention. Even just these two changes, Jenner and Jennings, effectively taught millions of people what being trans even meant. This language was not even known to most people only a year prior.

There is something very empowering about discovering or developing the language and concepts with which to make sense of the world around you. The random lines become a pattern, the noise becomes music, the mess becomes a system that you can predict and navigate.

If a society goes from nobody knows what trans people are, to that concept being the talk of the town, there's probably going to be some increase in the number of people who think about it and realize something about theirselves. It's similar to the way I've heard some people talk about mental health patterns, where if you have something like autism or ADHD, but you've never heard of those terms before, and you were living back in 1305, you might never know what's wrong with you.

# Pt. IV: Some remaining questions

## How many genders are there?

This is a question that got a lot of attention 10 years ago, which led to people defiantly claiming there's only two genders, in opposition to those who would entertain any other answers. Traditionally, gender was an abstraction based on observations about sex, which led to most cultures developing a simple binary understanding of *masculinity versus femininity*, which is enduringly intuitive for us today. However, there's no strict rule that prevents us from imagining other categories, if doing so feels useful. We could imagine that space between the two ends as its own category of some kind. We do this with colours, for comparison, when we label that space between red and blue 'purple'. The proposal is, at least, that we carve out a middle category called 'nonbinary' (this is the name everyone has settled on).

The argument for doing so is that our society has use-cases for such a concept, i.e. very androgynous people who identify and present as something in-between being very masculine or very feminine. However, it seems most discourse about this ends up being about the plausibility of creating such a category rather than whether there's a social need for it.

There are numerous things to consider:

* If it's not intuitive or doesn't click for enough people, it may simply never catch on and become socially meaningful. There's a good chance this is the case for a third gender. After all, dealing with only the concepts of masculine and feminine as a one-dimensional spectrum where the vast majority of people---i.e. something greater than 99 percent---are clearly and apparently one or the other is the norm and has been for centuries. It's the only real paradigm that most of us are used to. Our language and culture have developed around this being the case.
* The idea of somebody who is something other than a man or woman raises immediate questions for the way in which we think about such a person in relation to others, considering we live in a society with a gendered social order. If that person has sex with a man, are they gay or straight? If they use a gendered facility, do they use the men's or women's area? I don't know the answer.
* It's often so that people who self-identify as something other than 'man' or 'woman' are still seen or interpreted as either men or women by others in society, or in other words as nonbinary males or nonbinary females. This is probably what people would use to base their answers to my previous questions (a man who has sex with a nonbinary male would feel like he's having gay sex, while a man who has sex with a nonbinary female would not---and people would probably recommend the nonbinary male use the men's washroom, not the women's). Unless that nonbinary person is also a transsexual, in which case this flips. In conclusion, a nonbinary person's internal identity notwithstanding, their social experience tends to be gendered according to their phenotype.

There are some nonbinary people who claim they aren't "between" masculine and feminine, but off the spectrum entirely. What does that mean? For most people it's incoherent, comparable to somebody saying "I'm not tall or short, nor am I in between tall and short; I don't have a height" or "I'm not hot or cold, nor am I in between hot and cold; I don't have a temperature". It doesn't make sense to us, or at least it's not something whose meaning is easily interpretable for people who don't already "get it".

The most I've been able to make sense of it is as follows: some people have an inner sense of thinking about theirself as a masculine person and therefore trying to do masculine things. They want to walk in a masculine way, talk in a masculine way, do things that people consider masculine. And they want to avoid doing anything feminine. And vice versa for people who consider theirselves feminine instead. Imagine if a person said rather than holding one of these two attitudes, they feel no connection or aversion to either side, and just do what they want without consideration for the gendered associations of their choices or behaviour.

The way that I try to relate to this is thinking about possible distinctions between two categories where other people might have a preference but I don't. Let's try to come up with a couple examples: do I try to listen to music made in England, or America? I don't know. I don't really think about it. Some bands I like are English and some are American. How about when I buy coffee, do I favour beans grown in South America, Africa, or Asia? I don't know. I think the popular brands where I live are usually grown in Africa, but I'm not sure about that. There could be another aspect, where a person feels some kind of anxiety about being put in a box, made to choose between, and commit to, one thing or another. That could be how a person like this relates to the feeling of dysphoria, if they claim to.

What are the social consequences of any of this? I don't know. Possibly nothing. It's like asking what the social consequences are of somebody who claims to be aromantic. They don't experience romantic feelings at all. What does that mean to you? If you aren't trying to date them, then maybe nothing, you have no reason to care. But you get to learn a little bit more about how their brain works. When you live in a place where people have a lot of freedom to express what they want, you'll end up with people who express uncommon feelings, and sometimes they might come up with language to describe those feelings, even if it's not particularly consequential.

Perhaps confusingly, there are some categories of personal identity that don't seem to entail or require any particular external performance, and therefore are not necessarily visible to an outside observer. A person who claims to be nonbinary, agender, or some other gender-divergent identity might not seem to be any different from a normal man or woman, except in their self-reported internal feelings.

## Overlapping categories

Intersex people are not necessarily trans. There are intersex males who are also trans women, but there are some intersex males who remain men, and similar for intersex females.

Nonbinary and other gender-nonconforming people might also identify as transsexuals if they transition. There are some people who refer to theirselves as nonbinary trans, or trans nonbinary, meaning they transitioned, but after transitioning they consider theirselves nonbinary rather than the opposite sex.

These three categories can all have some overlap, but they're also distinct enough ideas that people can be one without the other two, or two without being the third.
