# Why get bottom surgery?

.2025-02-09

.'Bottom surgery' is a polite euphemism somebody made up to refer to procedures transsexuals get on their genitals. In this context it means a vaginoplasty.

In the past, if you wanted legal recognition as a trans woman, you had to get a vaginoplasty. No dicks in the lady's room. That was the rule. In some places another option was if you had an orchiectomy or some other form of castration instead. No balls in the lady's room. How nice of them. These days, getting surgery is less required and treated more like a personal choice. And it's a really difficult personal choice. There are some reasons to want to avoid it, which are more obvious than the reasons for it. It's scary. Surgery is scary. What if something goes wrong? They're cutting you open. It hurts. You take weeks or months recovering. It's anxiety-inducing because it's a big step, and there's no going back. And there are horror stories out there, if you look for them, of what a bad spot you could end up stuck in if things don't turn out well.

Less obvious are the reasons why trans women desire these procedures despite the fear and anxiety. For many people, the assumption is that trans women simply hate their penises, because gender dysphoria. We look down at them, think "oh no", and then want them gone. And like, okay, that's often part of it. Women aren't supposed to have penises, our subconscious minds tell us. That's not normal. So when we look at ourselves, and we see something very different from what other women have, it can make us feel wrong, broken, like there's something about us that isn't right. I've many times heard about trans women who *don't* have "genital dysphoria" early in their transition---focusing instead on things that are more apparent socially, like your face, hair, and clothes---but then, after years, they reach a point where they pass as females for the most part *except* for their penis, at which point it starts to bother them. It's the one thing that remains out of place.

However, even if a trans woman doesn't have an inner, psychological feeling of wrongness from associating her penis with being a man or whatever---or if she does feel that way but it's not *that* compelling a reason on its own, or it's something she could live with---there are other factors that play into the motivation. And in my case, and in the case of other trans women I've known, these other factors are significantly larger.

### Clothes

It's not easy clothes shopping for yourself if you feel like your dick is a secret that nobody is supposed to see bulging anywhere. It's not impossible to wear tights or tight-fitting pants, but it's uncomfortable and 'dangerous' (if you mess up). It also means good luck going out in a bikini or to a pool. It just makes everything awkward.

This might sound kind of frivolous, but the feeling that women's clothes don't work on you is bothersome, alienating, restricting. "This is supposed to the women's section---but I'm trans, so I can't realistically buy a lot of these things." It really makes you feel like you don't fit in. And finally having a lot of freedom in what you buy (and wear) was a significant benefit enjoyed by friends of mine after their surgeries. It was something they talked about glowingly for weeks.

### Other women's comfort

There are some women who are over it and don't particularly care if a trans woman has a penis. She's still a woman, she's still one of us, she's still our sister, feminism, woo, all that. But look, a lot of women just really don't like penises. The thought of somebody who has a penis being around them makes them uneasy. They really do think of the lady's room as the "no dicks allowed" room.

There are *many* women---who are not especially bigoted or ideological or political, but just normal normies---who feel okay  letting post-op trans women into their space, but feel very uneasy letting trans women who still have penises into their space. This might not bother every trans woman---but it should. Because cis women's comfort should matter to us. I don't just want to force myself in where people don't accept me. It's their space that I'm *asking* to be let into. I think on some level, having a penis makes women register you as a sexual threat. Losing your penis is like declawing a cat, or taking the ammo out of a gun. It makes you safe.

Another aspect of it might be that they consider getting bottom surgery to be the final proof that you're on their team. There's a paranoia that somebody could just be faking it, right? What if I say I'm a trans woman, but then I pull my dick out and go back into man-mode and harass you with it? That's how some people think. But if I'm at the point where I got rid of my dick, there's no question about my intentions and what team I'm on here. It's like the final test of your loyalty to womanhood.

### Feeling like you're hiding something

Have you ever snuck through a border checkpoint with contraband you're hoping the police don't find? No, and I suppose most people haven't, but imagine it. Have you ever shoplifted? Look, the point is, feeling like you have something to hide sucks. It wears on you mentally. I hate feeling scared when I use women's washrooms because it's like I'm going to get in trouble or freak somebody out if they see me.

This feels related to the previous point, but it's not the same. The previous point was about the impact you have on others, while this one is about the impact that feeling like you have something to hide has on you.

Relatedly, I'd love to go to one of those women's-only nude spas at some point, but it feels like that's impossible to do as a pre-op trans woman without accidentally creating a national news story. The social expectation for most normal people is that it's vaginas-only. If I had a vaginoplasty, I could actually feel confident going to something like that.

These two points are really the strongest for me. I don't like not fitting in with women, I don't like feeling like I'm a threat to them or going to make them uncomfortable, I don't like feeling like I have something to hide or something I'm getting away with. It feels awful, and this really weighs on you over time.

### Sexuality

This gets awkward to talk about, so bear with me. A lot of trans women are interested primarily in men, and having sex with men is difficult if you have a penis, because where does *their* penis go? There are options other than anal---not even all gay men have anal sex with each other. But the reality is that most dudes want to put their dick inside you, somewhere, somehow. It's like psychological for them. There are men who are into just frotting and jerking off or whatever, but if you go out and try to sleep with guys, the expectation a lot of the time is that if you're pre-op, they'll want to have anal sex.

So do you enjoy anal sex? Some trans women do. And for them, perhaps this last point isn't much of a factor, but frankly I do not, and having a sex life that is defined by anal sex does not sound like an enjoyable future at all. That's all I'll say on the matter. If I weren't attracted to men at all and knew I'd end up with a woman, this one aspect would matter way less, or possibly not at all. That does give me some pause, because it sounds like I'm being motivated to pursue surgery *for other people*---but is that bad? I'm saying I want a functional sex life, and I feel like a vaginoplasty makes that possible. And it's not the only factor, just a slice of the pie.

Are more men going to be into you if you're post-op? If you just go around asking men, "would you ever be a trans woman?", a lot of their answers revolve about cock. They say no, ew, I'm not into penises---but eh, maybe if she had surgery? They're just very repelled by penis. It really turns them off. But how many guys fall into that overlap where they're repelled by penis but still okay with a trans woman? I feel like a lot of men aren't into trans women for reasons well beyond our genitals. It's more, like, spiritual or something. The knowledge that you used to live as a male messes with their head and makes them feel gay and icky or something, no matter what you look like now.

I've talked with some trans people who are more experienced trying to date straight men than I am, and they've claimed the same men who are comfortable enough to sleep with a trans woman are generally the same guys who don't care that much if you have a penis. They're both mental barriers to overcome, and typically if somebody has a high enough level of personal security and open-mindedness to cross one, then they also cross the other.

## It's not as bad as people think

There's been lots of fearmongering about bottom surgery, which makes people view it more negatively than they should. The goal of many transphobic people online is trying to make you feel disgust at transsexuals. They want you to think we're gross, icky, disgusting people. They weaponize bottom surgery for this end. They refer to it as 'mutilation' and to the constructed vagina (which is, in medical literature, called a neovagina) as a 'wound', among other, even worse names. They ultimately would like it if these procedures were all outlawed forever so that we were no longer allowed to get them.

I always remember that old *South Park* episode where a character gets a sex change and they flash medical gore on screen to gross out the audience. The point of that entire episode was to convince you that transsexual women are disgusting and you should hate us. Thanks, guys. This was back when most people barely even knew trans people existed, too.

Over the years, I've seen many people online share post-surgery images of vaginoplasty patients. It looks kind of horrifying, admittedly, because it's shortly after a surgery. Have you seen the immediate aftermath of other types of surgery? They're often not pretty. A surgery fucks you up. They cut you open, move stuff around, and then you get sown up, you get stiches, bruising, everything hurts, and your body starts adjusting and healing, but that takes time, often weeks or months. If you look at vaginoplasty patients a year after surgery, they look fine---but people deliberately share pictures of people at, like, one week, because they're not trying to give you an accurate portrayal of the results of the procedure. They just want to gross you out and make you feel disgust at trans women.

The overall regret rate of a vaginoplasty is very low. I obviously can't say there's no risk, because there are possible complications of any surgery---but they're not common, you go in for a follow-up, and the surgeons know how to correct most problems if they arise. These procedures have been being done for a long time. It's not a new, scary field of unknown science. If bottom surgery is something that you like, then you shouldn't feel like you're playing Russian roulette, because you're not. It's a reasonably safe procedure, and chances are very high that you're going to get out of it exactly what you went in expecting.
