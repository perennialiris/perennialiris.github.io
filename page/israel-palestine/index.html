# Israel--Palestine

.2025-07-27

Israel--Palestine can feel like the most divisive, polarizing issue ever. It's one where you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on my side or you're a bad person. Are you siding with Hamas, the terrorists and antisemites who use their own people as human shields? No, no, wait---I meant to say: Are you siding with Israel, the powerful military trying to ethnically cleanse the land they're stealing from Palestinians to fulfil their colonialist ideology? And no, sitting this one out isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor. And if somebody asks your position and you seem evasive, they assume the worst. The only way to stay safe is if nobody ever asks you about it to begin with.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. It's strained some of mine. I'm willing to take that risk over certain issues, where if somebody disagrees with me I'd prefer they know. But as this topic was so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, let alone change minds, that it often felt pointless to get into---and it wasn't immediately relevant real-world politics anyway (most voters just don't care much about conflicts on the other side of the world, so you're not winning any elections by focusing on this). And "just avoid the convo" is what many people in society did as well, just avoiding the conversation or shrugging and saying they don't know much about it but they wish everyone could live in peace---until the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war pushed the conflict back into the spotlight and made it fashionable to have a strong opinion about.

As debate about Israel--Palestine now seems unavoidable and is in the public interest (i.e. I'm now *expected*, in a way that I wasn't a few years ago, to have a clear position about it), I've here compiled my own thoughts about every aspect of the scenario I can think of. If you'd like to argue with me about it, you can direct me to what part of this page you disagree with.

# Background

To make this all more accessible to somebody who hasn't read much about the topic, I'll start with a few maps, some info about the region, and clear definitions of important terms.

zagros-mountains.png|The Zagros mountain range|I include this picture because I mention it in the text. We think of the Middle East as a desert, but as you go north of Saudi Arabia it gets rocky and that's sort of where the Arab cultural reach ends.

The language, Arabic, is named after the Arabian Peninsula, the geographical chunk of land at the southwest end of Asia (Saudi Arabia and the countries southeast of it). But when I talk about the **Arab world**, this mean Arabic-speaking countries, which extends up to Lebanon, into Africa (Somalia, Sudan, and along the north to Morocco). And throughout this page, I'm basically only talking about the Arab countries in the **Middle East**. Notably, this overlap excludes Turkey and Iran, which are Middle Eastern but not Arab (i.e. they aren't Arabic-speaking and their people are not considered Arabs).

The geography of the region, especially the Zagros Mountain range along western Iran, contributed to a sharp cultural divide historically around the Iraq--Iran border, east of which the common language is Farsi, spoken in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. Turkey, to the north, meanwhile, is one of the Turkic states (along with Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan), meaning its ethnic and linguistic origin is with the migration and eventual settlement of the Turkic people, nomads who originated in the Eurasian Steppe (kind of like the Mongols, but from a different part of Asia).

Arabic is strongly associated with Islam because the religion itself originated in the Arabic Peninsula (Muhammad was born and lived his life there) and its holy texts are written in Arabic. The spread of Arabic therefore accompanied the spread of Islam and in some places became the new dominant language (hence the Arab world), though even in places where it didn't (like Iran), all Muslims learn at least some Arabic, both to read the Quran and to perform Islamic prayers. We might comparable this with how some Christians learn a bit of Latin because of the Catholic Church, but Arabic is substantially more central to Islam than Latin is to Christianity.

## Israel and Judea

||image-float
israel-and-judea.png|Approx. location of ancient Israel (blue) and Judea (orange) over modern borders|A map showing the ancient kings of Israel and Judea overlaying the borders of modern Israel and its neighbouring territories

In roughly 1200--1100 BC, there were two kingdoms in the Levant---a northern one called Israel, and a southern one called Judea. Some of the dates and boundaries are hard to be precise about because it was so long ago, though we know more about it than other places in that same time period because its histories were incorporated into religious texts and therefore preserved. The two kingdoms were eventually combined, and the northern part, Israel, had a central capital known as Samaria, the site of which is in the West Bank today. There are some Jewish people today who talk about the "Samaria area" when referring to the West Bank to reinforce the notion of the Jews' historical connection to this region.

These kingdoms were all destroyed by ancient Babylonians (587 BC), who expelled the Jews from the region, many going to land that is now Iraq. Then Persia conquered the place and let the Jews come back (539 BC). Then the Romans destroyed the place again and kicked the Jews out again (70 AD). Eventually some Jews made their way to Europe (1000 AD), settling mostly in Germany and becoming the Ashkenazi Jewish population many of us know today.

This history is why there are Jewish people in Israel today who come off as feeling entitled to the region, including not only modern Israel but the West Bank, too. They grew up learning that this area used to be theirs and it was taken from their ancestors, but now they've come back to reclaim it as theirs once more. This is supported by their religion, which says their god promised this land to Abraham and to all his descendents forever, known as the "promised land". This is currency in a world that has become so focused on and oriented around *nations* over the last few centuries.

.Judea used to be spelled 'Judah', and is sometimes rendered as 'Judaea'. These are all transliterations of the same Hebrew word, and all refer to the same thing. Some people spell it differently depending on what time period they're referring to, because 'Judah' was the oldest transliteration, the Romans wrote it as 'Judaea', and 'Judea' is the most accurate transliteration that's used in a modern context (the word is pronounced 'joo-DEE-ah'). I prefer to use the modern spelling, Judea, regardless of context.

## The importance of Jerusalem

||image-float
jerusalem-location.png|Location of Jerusalem along Israel--West Bank border

Do you notice how the shape of Israel protrudes eastward to reach the city of Jerusalem? Jerusalem is one of the oldest continuously populated places in the world, and has importance in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Israelis and Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital, and for decades it was divided between the two, though today it's controlled only by Israel.

The city contains an area called the Temple Mount, which is where Jews believe Solomon's Temple stood 2,900 years ago. This contained various things that were important to Judaism, like the actual stone tablets Moses wrote the ten commandments onto, called the Tablets of the Law, stored inside a fancy chest called the Ark of the Covenant. Nobody knows where that thing went after the city was destroyed, which is why Indiana Jones was looking for it. The temple also had what they called the "holy of holies" (a transliteration of a Hebrew superlative---it could've been rendered simply as "the most holy thing"), meaning a special location where "god's presence" could be felt in a secret back room that only the high priest was allowed to visit, and only once per year. Perhaps god was a bit shy.

They also had a very special rock, which from the sounds of it looked just like a normal rock, but which they thought was the first part of the world god created, and therefore the spiritual centre that all creation flowed out from. It also had other significance, e.g. some people believe it's where Abraham took his son for his almost-sacrifice before the angel told him it was just a prank. Today, we're *pretty sure* we know where this rock is, and it's called the *foundation stone*, which is also the term we use for the very first brick you place when putting up a building. The rock might've also been the location of the holy of holies. For anything I say about this, though, know there's probably some sect of Jews who dispute it.

After the Persians allowed Jews to return to Israel in 539 BC, they built another temple where Solomon's Temple used to be. Solomon's Temple became known as the First Temple, and the one they had just built has since been known as the Second Temple. This was added to significantly by King Herod I (72--4 BC), the Jewish ruler of Judea.

Then Christianity happened. Jesus was born in Bethlehem and grew up in Nazareth, then travelled to Jerusalem where he was crucified, buried, and resurrected (~33 AD). Worshipping him became illegal for a few hundred years. About 37 years after Jesus died, in 70 AD, the Jewish--Roman war happened, which during Roman forces siege Jerusalem and destroy the Second Temple, and all the Jews were kicked out again. The Romans then built various temples to their own gods in the city instead.

||image-float

western-wall.png|The Western Wall in 2005 (the Dome of the Rock is visible in the top left)
dome-of-the-rock.png|The Dome of the Rock in the Al-Aqsa compound (2007)

When they returned sometime later, the only remaining part of the Second Temple to be found was a section of an exterior retaining wall that had been added by Herod, which is now known as the **Western Wall**, or the Wailing Wall. You may have seen videos or picture of people praying here. It's a popular thing to travel to Israel to see.

Then in 312, the Roman emperor Constantine had a vision of a lowercase 't' in the sky or something and converted to Christianity, declaring the religion legal (Edict of Milan) and trying to locate the tomb they put Jesus in that time. They eventually found a place underneath some other temple, so they dug that one up and replaced it with a church they called the **Church of the Holy Sepulchre** ("sepulchre" is just an old word that means a burial chamber). This is now one of the most holy places in all of Christianity, even though growing up among Christians in the West I never heard anyone talk about the place. Maybe it's a bigger deal for Christians over in the Middle East.

Then Islam happened. Their prophet Muhammad (570--632) was born in Mecca, but travelled to Jerusalem at some point, where he literally ascended to heaven and talked to god. Then he came back to earth and did more stuff, before dying of natural causes in the city of Medina. Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem became the holiest places to Islam. And Muslims also believed in the holy of holies and the special rock thing, so they went back and built a shrine on top of it called the **Dome of the Rock**, surrounded by mosques in an area called Al-Aqsa. The rock-dome thing is now the oldest piece of Islamic architecture in the world and is the obvious centrepiece of the Al-Aqsa compound area.

In conclusion: everybody thinks Jerusalem is significant, and both Jews and Muslims want to control it for their own reasons and for some shared reasons. That's why Israelis were happy to gain control of the eastern part of the city in 1967---the Temple Mount is on the eastern side, and they weren't allowed to go pray at the Western Wall when it was under Jordanian control.

This is also why Israelis were pleased when the US government officially moved its Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, as this implicitly means they're declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel, which had been contested before then.

# Terms clarifications

||table this td { border: 1px dotted var(--grey-8); }
**Gaza**, or the **Gaza Strip** | The small territory in the western corner of Israel, a densely-populated area with a few major cities (the main city, in the north, is called Gaza city, and is *sometimes* referred to simply as Gaza when talking about people moving within the region); many of its residents today descendents of refugees displaced from Israel in the 1940s. Gaza is central to the Israel--Palestine conflict.
**West Bank** | The larger Palestinian territory on the **east** side of Israel, so called because it's the west bank of the [Jordan River](media/jordan-river.png), the natural feature that separates Israel from Jordan. Along with Gaza, the West Bank is central to the Israel--Palestine conflict.
**Palestine** | Historically, "Palestine" was a region in the Ottoman Empire that encompassed Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Today, the term effectively means "the remaining parts of that territory that didn't become Israel", and as such refer to the non-contiguous territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
the **Golan Heights**, or the **Golan** | The region north of Israel, a plateau between Israel and Syria; currently controlled by Israel, though this is considered an illegal occupation and it's sometimes referred to as an Israeli-occupied part of Syria. Israel took the region because Syrian forces used the high ground against them, and now it functions as a strategic buffer zone between itself and the rest of Syria.
**IDF** | Israeli Defense Forces (the Israeli military).
**Zionism** | The movement started by Jews in late-19th century Europe to create a Jewish nation-state, ideally in the Middle East near their historical homeland. The name originates from Mount Zion, a place in Jerusalem. People who advocate for, support, or defend the existence of a "Jewish state" (i.e. any state where Jews are the majority and ergo have "self-determination") is broadly described as a Zionist.
**Anti-Zionism** | In the broadest sense, an anti-Zionist is somebody who opposed the Zionist movement in some way or another, but the most common form has been opposition to the existence of a Jewish-majority state in the Middle East. In the Arab world, this was based on the belief that this was all rightfully 'Arab land' and the Jews ergo had no right to political autonomy in the region. The creation of Israel was disruptive to pan-Arab or Islamic political unity, and was generally interpreted as being tantamount to foreign interference in the region because much of Israel's founding population was of European origin and its formation was shaped by Britain and the UN.
the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (the PLO) | A coalition to represent the Palestinian people, created in 1964. It became the official representative of "Palestine" at the United Nations in 1974. Initially the PLO was labelled a terrorist group, as its stated goal was the destruction of Israel and it engaged in guerilla violence throughout the region, but by the 1980s its approach had shifted to being more moderate and negotiating.
the **Palestine Authority** (officially the Palestinian National Authority) | After the Oslo Accords (1993--95), the Palestinian territories were put under control of the Palestine Authority, a semi-autonomous government body that controlled the West Bank and Gaza. It had a president and a legislative council, usually controlled by Fatah, its largest political party. Notably, in 2006 the PA lost control of Gaza to Hamas.
**Fatah** | A political party in Palestine (formalized as such in 1965), the majority party in the Palestine Authority's legislative council, and the largest party in the PLO. Like the PLO, it was initially more radical and violent, but became more compromising and practical over time.
**Mossad** | A common name for the Israeli national intelligence agency; derived from the Hebrew for *institution*.
**Ansar Allah**, commonly known as the **Houthis** | The militant Islamist group that controls western Yemen. They came to prominence in 2014, but gained more attention in 2023 after they started attacking ships passing through the Red Sea. It's called the Houthis because they're led by a powerful clan called the al-Houthi family.
**Hamas** (the Islamic Resistance Movement) | The government of Gaza (since 2007), but also its affiliated militant Islamist wing; the intended meaning varies by context, though the latter use (the terrorist organization) is more common.
**Hezbollah** (Party of Allah) | The militant Islamist group that operates in southern Lebanon, which has infiltrated the Lebanon government and exists as a parallel force within Lebanon.
the **Arab League** | An international forum of Arabic-speaking countries, formed in 1945. Its founding members were Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Jordan (then called Transjordan), and North Yemen (a kingdom that predated modern Yemen).
**mosque** | A mosque is a Muslim place of worship, their version of a church.
**caliph** | A caliph is a Muslim ruler who claims to be the successor to be the spiritual and political leader of the entire Muslim world, like the Pope and the Emperor mixed into the same position.
**caliphate** | The region ruled by a caliph is called a caliphate, and there have been many caliphates throughout history, sometimes multiple competing ones claiming to be the one true caliphate. The Ottoman Sultan was generally considered a caliph (sometimes a 'sultan-caliph'), and the Ottoman Empire could also have been called the Ottoman Caliphate (though for various reasons this wasn't officially used).

# Why care about this topic?

It's interesting, and it involves a lot of different stories and narratives all coming together into a mess where everybody has a point and everybody has valid complaints.

But it's common, when talking about Israel--Palestine, for people to accuse one another of having only the worst of intentions. This makes dialogue very challenging. How can you find common ground with somebody who's just plain evil? I become disinterested when somebody accuses me of either only criticizing Israel because I hate Jews, or of only defending Israel because I hate Arabs or Muslims. At that point we're no longer really talking about Israel--Palestine, but having a meta-conversation about my motivation for talking about it. And if that's truly what somebody believes about me, then I don't know why they would want to talk to me anyway.

There *is* a realistic danger of people being guided through this topic by bad intentions or being influenced by prejudice. A person who's very pro-Israel could be motivated by racism and dehumanization of Arabs or Muslims. We've all seen people who think of Palestinians as uncivilized savages, or as people who are incapable of peace, incapable of living in modern society, who are naturally violent and intolerant and drawn to terrorism. They ultimately view the Palestinians as nothing more than a nuisance, and some of them wouldn't mind if Israel just decided to wipe them out all already. They act as though all Palestinians are guilty of the actions of terrorist groups, and they also weaponize the fact Palestinians have an Islamic culture that is repressive of homosexuality and of women's rights, as though being born into such a culture is a crime for which the Palestinians deserve some kind of cosmic punishment.

And then, when it comes to people who are very critical of Israel, the fear is they could be motivated by antisemitism, or a bias against Jewish people. I've encountered people who seem to fit this description. They fixate on Israeli wrongdoing, while ignoring all other wars, conflicts, and cruelty elsewhere in the world, even just elsewhere in the Middle East. They seem to care about international law, but really only care when Israel is violating it. They seem to care about genocidal and dehumanizing rhetoric, except when it's directed against Jews. They fall into conspiracy theories about Jews pulling the strings in Western governments, manipulating our foreign policy, controlling our media. They say, through the language of "anti-Zionism", that it's impossible for Jewish people to be the majority and have political self-determination without all turning into genocidal monsters for some reason. And they offer endless compassion and understanding for Arabs who engage in terrorism, but none at all for innocent Jews born into Israel, surrounded by people who want them dead, growing up learning about how most of their people's history has been fleeing persecution, and wanting to be able to feel safe in their homeland.

I'm wary of either possibility, and I do what I can to combat racist or dehumanizing speech in our community. I will argue that most Palestinians are unworthy of scorn or hatred, that they're our fellow human beings and how we treat them matters---including those of them who are actually in terrorist groups, which is not the majority. As I've said before, the greatest test of your morality is how you treat somebody who's at your mercy. I likewise try to be wary about how Jewish people are treated and spoken of, which in my case---because I tend to interact with more left-wing people than right-wing these last few years---has so far been the greater of two struggles.

I've many times heard it asked why people in the West care so much about Israel--Palestine either way. The implication can be that a person's focus on it, of all things, is evidence for their having bad motives. But we must admit there are plenty of legitimate reasons for a person in the West to be very attentive to the Israel--Palestine conflict, and even to give it far more attention than wars or conflicts elsewhere in the world. Consider the many points of entry at which a person could become acutely aware of it in the first place:

* We are all likely to become *aware* of Israel because our history classes invariably teach about World War II, the Holocaust, and the League of Nations. In this way, the founding of Israel feels related to our own history, and what happens there may feel like our fault or our responsibility, which can give somebody motivation to care how it turns out.
* We could hear about it each election cycle, when some of our politicians get on stage and clarify their support for Israel. It's something they get asked about in debates. I specifically recall that in past elections in my home country of Canada, the Conservative Party would include their support for Israel as a list item somewhere on their party platform on their website. I don't believe any other countries were explicitly mentioned like this. I understand why somebody thought to include it on that page, but I can also understand a person unfamiliar with the conflict seeing that and thinking, hey, what gives? Is that something I should be worried about? Why is this country so important that politicians feel the need to talk about it, of all things? In this way, the emphasis, the idea that it should stand out among all other conflicts in the world, is really given to us by society.
I can also imagine that if people in my government were all expected to have a position on what's happening in Andorra, then I would instantly want to know more about what's happening there than I do now, which is practically nothing (the fact I can point to it on a map likely places me as above-average for Andorra-related knowledge). Then, if I found out the Andorran government were doing things I find gravely immoral, I might be upset if so many people in our government wanted to keep sending them aid.
* The Israel--Palestine conflict has become noteworthy because of its longevity. It's been going on for so long, and is so commonly seen as intractable, that for much of my life "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline, a simile for an unrealistic goal that you don't know how to achieve. This itself can make people curious: what could be so difficult about it? Why *hasn't* the world been able to get these two groups to stop fighting and killing each other after so long? There must be something about it, right?
* There's been more activism on behalf of the Palestinian cause than for either side of many other issues. We could ask why that is---but we could also step back and realize it's not any one person's fault this is the case. We can't blame somebody for being more aware of Israel--Palestine than they are of the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria when they grew up in an environment where their peers were talking about one more than the other.
* In some cases, the person might also be Jewish, be of Middle Eastern descent, or have a close friend who is, which gives them some personal connexion to the conflict. Though you'll encounter plenty of white people who don't have an explanation like this (me, for instance), the percentage of people who at least *know* either a Jewish or Middle Eastern person is probably fairly high in some places.

Then, once you start looking into Israel--Palestine, you find so much material, so many different stories, and it branches out into so many other topics, that it can easily keep you occupied for a long time. It leads to discussion and debate about the history of the region, which is told differently depending on whom you ask; to talking about how we feel about our history of imperialism and colonialism, what impact these high-level policy decisions made by diplomats and emperors in fancy rooms could have on the lives of powerless people in villages far away, and what obligation we have to deal with the lingering effects of past injustice, and how; to talking about international law, the laws of armed conflict, how they're interpreted, how they should be enforced, and whether our current international laws are perfect and should be deferred to at all times or whether they might actually have problems or limitations; and even to discussing fundamental questions about the very nature of a country or a national identity---like, what does it mean to be a Palestinian? What is a valid or invalid basis on which to found a country?

# Competing intuitions

Let's take a few steps back. Imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine and you're approaching it for the first time, intent on forming a position. You have no bias about it, you haven't been influenced to think one way or another, you're just a normal person who doesn't hate Jews or Muslims. If you started looking into the topic today, or perhaps a few years ago before the recent war escalated, what would be your initial impression? It depends. The conflict triggers different intuitions depending on who's examining it. We aren't bound to those first intuitions, but many people never move past them simply because they don't commit much time to thoroughly challenge their own intuitions. Regardless, what sort of thoughts come to mind for you? Let's consider some possibilities.

In no particular order:

#### 1. Favour the side that does less bad stuff.

If it's a war between two sides, then maybe we should just ask which side is morally worse. If you look at Israel and then at groups like Hamas or Hezbollah, there's a lot about each of them to lead a normal person to figure Israel is less bad---perhaps not angels, but further from devils. They have a better system of government, better laws, better culture, they do better on women's rights, gay rights, religious tolerance, freedom of speech, democracy, adherence to international norms. Who would rather side with the Islamist fascists? I'd much rather live in Tel Aviv.

#### 2. Choose the side that aligns with us.

If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and wants to be our friend and is happy to work with us, and is a generally valuable asset in our broader goals in the region, then maybe we should shrug and pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is a good ally to the West, and if we decided that wasn't important anymore, it's not like we could feasibly switch sides anyway because Israel's enemies all hate us. This, realistically, is how many people are approaching the issue (including all our politicians). "Israel wants to be our friend, and the people who they're fighting hate us, ergo Israel is the side we're on; the end."

#### 3. Favour the underdog.

With great power comes great responsibility. If one side of a conflict is far more wealthy and powerful than the other, then they're the ones who are really in control, and they have a greater responsibility to act properly and direct the conflict in a moral way. In this case, Israel is holding all the cards while the Palestinians are oppressed, so if the state of things is unacceptable, then Israel is the country we should be blaming and expecting to make a change. This is another common perspective with a broad psychological appeal.

#### 4. Side with the native population.

If we're invading a country and taking over the native people there, then we're the baddies, right? It probably doesn't become okay just because we can find some aspect of their culture we find immoral, which is, indeed, a tactic that colonialists utilized, like with widow-burning in India, or human sacrifice in Mesoamerica.

This is an intuition that you can cast onto the Middle East, as some people view Israel a country of people who are foreign to the area and therefore colonizers, whereas Palestinians are the natives who were there first. This means before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same piece of land, Israel has less legitimacy, and Palestinians are in the right in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as an extension of a broader Western interest in having some levers of power in the Middle East, which could be something a person opposes, especially if their political views are especially far left.

In actuality, many Israelis are not "foreigners" at all, even if we ignore that this region is where Jewish people originated long ago. In the early years of Zionism, there were a lot of Jewish settlers from Europe who helped increase the population, but today the majority are Jews born in Israel, many of them descended from Jewish families that fled to Israel from elsewhere in the Middle East, meaning they're not even of European origin. Nonetheless, this intuition is persuasive for some people.

#### 5. Oppose Jewish influence.

Jewish people have long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the West, there are people whose view of Israel is they're manipulators, that they attacked the USS *Liberty*, that they had something to do with 9/11, they use their control of media companies and AIPAC to control American foreign policy, they want to drag us into wars in the Middle East for their own benefit. They side against Israel in their conflict with the Arab world because they think of Israelis as nefarious Jews whom they want nothing to do with. This is more common among right-wing people, especially conspiracy theorists, though many of their memes and arguments have infected the left as well.

#### 6. Be mindful of our prejudice.

Liberal people try to be self-aware about the danger of bias and prejudice, and compensate for that in their evaluation of things. In the Israel--Palestine conflict they may see a danger of siding with Israelis because Palestinians are poorer, they're Muslims, and they're seen as less "white" than Jews (because of how European Jews are portrayed in Western media---in actuality, many Jews look more like other Middle Eastern peoples). To counteract this, Jews are placed under a higher level of scrutiny, because we're trying to self-reflect and check ourselves. So in practice, this works out in the Palestinians' favour.

#### 7. Anti-American bias.

A far-left tendency is to oppose the US exerting control around the world. They criticize everything that happens in international affairs through the lens of wanting to reduce the American sphere of influence. In the Israel--Palestine conflict, they view Israel as an extension of American interests, or as a puppet of the US, being used as a divide to destabilize the Middle East for our own purposes. Israel's very existence is therefore opposed, and the countries that want to destroy Israel are often favoured. The people who fall into this also hate Saudi Arabia (an American ally) and hate Iran and China (American enemies).

Of these, which intuition(s) do you find most appealing? When I first began trying to sort out all my thoughts about this conflict, the one that affected my thinking the most was the first example I listed: "choose the side that does less bad stuff". That's just part of how I navigate conflicts. If you were to tell me a war just broke out between two factions in any other random country on the planet and I had to take a side, I would start by asking which faction is less evil.

In applying that lens to Israel--Palestine, I made the following observations:

* Israel's government is something like a middling European democracy---flawed, but aspiring in the right direction. They have freedom of speech, they allow vocal criticism of the government, you're allowed to form opposition parties and vote the current government out of power. Their military is also held to a far higher standard than any other in the region. There are some problematic aspects of Israeli society, but in terms of its overall character, it's far less oppressive than average for this part of the world.
* The terrorist groups Israel is at war with aren't seeking freedom; they're basically fascists. They want to implement an authoritarian, theocratic society powered by radical Islam. And in their fight to destroy Israel, they have virtually no ethics, they have no respect for international law, they have no regard for civilian deaths, no, all bets are off, they're willing to do anything it takes to win. This is not a normal "resistance movement"; it's a resistance movement that's been hijacked by crazy people.
* Hamas and other Islamist groups openly proclaim their goal is not ending the occupation of Palestine, but the eradication of Jews and the complete destruction of Israeli society. They say not death to Israelis, but death to the Jews---and that's not a mistake; they're well aware of the distinction. They aren't against Arab Israelis, and non-Israeli Jews don't get a pass. If they got their way, they would carry out a second Holocaust.

For me, this formed a reasonable basis for leaning toward support for Israel, but I still had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort to brutality *after decades of injustice* cancel out that initial injustice? No. If Israel is imposing unjust conditions onto the Palestinians, then any intuition about Israel seeming to operate in a more moral way in the present can't be the end of the story.

If you aren't sure what I mean, imagine a slave society where some people are owned as property. A group of rebel slaves break free and rampage through the streets. They kill whole families, they rape women, they laugh while doing it. I could say these rebels had done something immoral, and that would be true---but their actions being immoral doesn't speak to whether the conditions of slavery were justified to begin with. It would be a mistake to let that distract me from also condemning the latter, which is actually the far greater crime overall.

An immoral thing can appear better than it is when it becomes part of a system that legitimizes it through rules and procedure, and people grow used to it over time. What if the system itself is evil? What if we've grown accustomed to evil? This is what the Palestinian cause demands we investigate. Is there something abhorrent and unacceptable about the status quo, like slavery, that Palestinians are forced to endure, and which it would be wrong of us to overlook while condemning the latest Hamas attack?

# The history of the conflict

## Pre-1948

Even before Nazi Germany, Jews were mistreated in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904), a Jewish man born in what is today Budapest, founded modern **Zionism** by proposing (in 1895) that Jews should unite and form a state of their own, rather than try to assimilate to their host nations, as many Jews were then attempting. Herzl came to believe that Jews could never truly feel secure living as a minority in Christian Europe, where Jews were, despite their best efforts, forever victims of antisemitism, treated with suspicion, called aliens and outsiders, used as scapegoats, and periodically massacred in pogroms that destroyed whole Jewish communities. It was just one tragedy after another going back centuries. The movement Herzl started lived on in the decades after his early death, and the case for his proposal would only become stronger as events unfolded.

Zionism was a secular movement, focused less on Judaism as a religion and more on the Jews as a people. It was named after Zion, or Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, which was poetically as a metonym for Jerusalem itself, or for all of Israel, via the ancient kingdom of Israel. The name signified that if Jewish people were to have a homeland, it ought to be in the place their people were from historically, which was, indisputably, the region of Palestine, where once were the ancient Jewish kingdoms of Israel and Judea, where Soloman's Temple was built in 957 BC to house the Ark of the Covenant, from which the Jews were exiled to Babylon (modern Iraq) and have been living as a diaspora in various countries ever since.

But in the late 19th century, for the Jews to create a state in Palestine wasn't yet feasible. Two important events created opportunity, the second being the displacement of Jews from much of Europe by Nazi Germany, and the first being **World War I** (1914--1918). As a consequence of WWI, the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled a large part of the Middle East from its capital in Constantinople, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides of the war, and Britain supporting an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule (1916). The following year, with WWI still ongoing, Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary and former Prime Minister, declared that, after the war, Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in a region called Palestine, then under Ottoman control. His letter of support to the Jewish community is now known as the **Balfour declaration**. It was deliberately vague, not defining its terms or specifying an exact location, region size, or proposed boundaries. It was simply to be "in Palestine".

There were already problems. A year before the Balfour declaration, Britain made promises to Arab leaders to recognize Arab independence after the war---though, like the Balfour declaration, their promises weren't very specific, and people would later argue over the correct interpretation of what either side even really said. This traces back to a series of letters in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahon--Hussein correspondence**, between British diplomat Henry McMahon and Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi (1854--1931), the Sharif of Mecca who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. A proponent of pan-Arabism (a desire for all Arab nations to form a single Arab state), Hussein declared himself caliph after the war, but detested the Balfour declaration and refused to coöperate with the British (e.g. he refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles). This eventually led to the British supporting Ibn Saud, who in 1925 conquered Hejaz and took Mecca, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

sykes-picot-agreement.png|The Sykes--Picot Agreement (modern borders faded)|The "A" section was to be controlled by France and "B" would be controlled by Britain, maybe, or something like that.

In 1916, Britain also made a secret agreement with France and other countries called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement**, which would partition control of Ottoman territory in the Levant after the war. There would be areas directly under British control, some under French control, and some Arab states but divided into English and French spheres of interest. Palestine, because it contained sites of religious and cultural significance to Jews and Muslims, was going to be carved out separately and put under international control of some kind, with the details varying as the agreement went through different iterations. These talks meant Britain couldn't promise lands north of the Sykes--Picot line, where French influence began. In 1920, despite any earlier plans, the United Nations gave Britain an explicit mandate to control Palestine until it could become self-governing, and it became known as **Mandatory Palestine** while under British control. This was arguably not inconsistent with what was committed to in the McMahon--Hussein correspondence, in which McMahon did not unconditionally promise all Arab-speaking places, but only of "those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France".

After WWI, the Ottoman empire had lost its Arabian territories and was in a state of near-collapse, its power mostly limited to the Anatolian plateau around Constantinople, and the Allies were trying to prosecute members of the Ottoman government for their role in the Armenian genocide (1915--17). The Ottoman Sultan who ruled throughout most of WWI, Mehmed V, had just died shortly before the end of the war, and his half-brother, Mehmed VI, inherited the situation. What little power MehMed VI had was then challenged by the rising Turkish Nationalist movement, led by Atatürk, the man himself. Allied forces then occupied Constantinople, and so began the **Turkish War of Independence** (1919--23), in which Turkish Nationalists fought to repel the Allies from the country, formally ended the Ottoman Empire (1922), and established the modern republic of Turkey (1923). (Constantinople was officially renamed to Istanbul in 1930.)

A lot was changing in the world. Countries were rising and falling, borders being redrawn, and in the background, millions of normal people were picking up their lives and migrating to avoid conflict and to be part of the communities of their choice. In the interwar period (1918--39), tens of thousands of Jewish people continued migrating into Mandatory Palestine, settling new towns, developing farmland, but also leading to conflict and tension with the Arab population in that area. The British even limited how many Jews were allowed to migrate to the region in the 20s because they noticed it was leading to problems, and it was still their responsibility to keep the peace. Though some Jewish people had always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to them at this time was exacerbated by the perception they were Europeans, foreigners coming into the region from abroad---a tragically ironic fate for the Jews, considered aliens both in Europe and in the Levant. (In the following decades, many Jews throughout the rest of the Middle East would flee persecution to Israel, and so Israel became less "European" the more time went by.)

un-1947-partition.png|UN Res. 181 (passed 1947)|A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region---not carelessly in half, but with respect to the existing population and its demography while trying to create a Jewish-majority region per the wishes of the Zionist movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would end up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' would've been only barely majority-Jewish. In other words, they put as many Muslims as possible into the Jewish side without going over half, then gave the rest to Muslims as well. On the other hand, this resulted in the Jewish side having more land per person. The city of Jerusalem, with its historical and religious importance to both Jews and Muslims, would become a "special international zone".

Arabs viewed the partition plan as unfairly benefitting the Jews. They boycotted participation in the negotiations, and refused to accept any partition plan proposed. The UN passed the resolution anyway (1947), and fighting between Jews and Muslims broke out across the country (1948 Palestine war), but British forces did little to intervene and simply began withdrawing from the region, leaving everybody to fend for theirselves. Just as the British Mandate officially ended, the newly constituted State of Israel declared its independence (May 14, 1948), and both sides prepared for war. The armies of all surrounding Arab countries---Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen---would invaded the region (1948 Israel--Palestine war), but Israel fought back and somehow held its own, leading to a stalemate in 1949, and then to all countries involved signing an armistice agreement in 1949. The armistice lines (where the armies on both sides were pushed up to when the fighting stopped) became the de facto borders of Israel for the next few decades. Notably, the city of Jerusalem was cut in half, with Israel controlling the west and Jordan controlling the east.

For Israelis, this was a victory. They had to fight for it, lives were lost, and they didn't get all the territory they hoped for, but they finally had a country to call their own. It was even in their ancestral homeland, where they had access to historical religious sites, including the literal hill they call 'Mount Zion' (though the Temple Mount, site of the first temple built by King Soloman, considered the holiest site in Judaism, remained under Jordan's control in East Jerusalem until 1967).

However, as part of the fighting in the first part of the 1948 war, Israeli forces attacked Muslim Arabs all across the territory they controlled, and hundreds of Palestinian villages were looted and destroyed. In total, by the end of it, around 700,000 Arabs had fled or were directly expelled, most of them going to the remaining Palestinian territories then controlled by Egypt and Jordan, where they built new lives as refugees. Arabs today refer to this year of violent displacement as **the Nakba** (Arabic for *catastrophe*), which became the uniting story of Palestinian identity.

* In modern English, "mount" is often associated with mountains, like Mount Everest or Mount Fuji, but in the past it was used more loosely for any elevated ground. The hill called "Mount Zion" wasn't an important geographical feature; it was just noteworthy because that's where they built the city of Jerusalem. And as far as I can tell, nobody knows what "Zion" originally meant, beyond that it was the name people used for that area.

### The pro-Israeli, Western perspective

Why have so many people in the West been pro-Israel for so long? A big part of it is they had a compelling, heroic narrative. The Jews were a powerless, persecuted minority, victims of the most terrible genocide of all time. Even after liberating them from the Nazis, many powerful Western countries didn't care about them. Jewish refugees were turned away, rejected, and continued to be treated badly. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. How could they? So they united, they came together in solidarity and resistance, and they created their own space where they could feel safe and have autonomy. They were attacked, but they persevered and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who wanted them all dead. It was glorious, the ultimate comeback story.

Today, the underdog mentality benefits Palestinians, but during the Cold War, it played for Israel. Just look at them on a map, surrounded by larger countries with bigger populations. Israel was the underdog in the Middle East. And while the rest of the world was fighting for democracy against the threat of Communism, Israel was on our side. They were the only democracy in the Middle East, while significant parts of the Arab world, like Egypt and Syria, were allied with the Soviets. The USSR distributed anti-Zionist propaganda depicting the Jews as puppets of the US, and supported the Palestinian cause, especially into the 1970s when both the US and USSR became more directly invested in the conflict.

Israel's victories felt like our victories. They were our friend, beating up our enemies. That's how it felt for people alive at the time. And then Reagan told Gorbachev to tear down that wall, everybody clapped, the USSR fell apart, the American space program put a man on the moon, Elvis, Michael Jackson, rock and roll, Sunday morning football, a good paying job down at the plant, and it all blurs together into this collective memory a time when it kicked ass to be American.

Then 9/11 happened. The American public was completely unprepared for the trauma that having a foreign enemy attack them on their own territory would inflict. Suddenly everybody realized there was a group of people called Muslims, and they didn't like them or want to see them on airplanes. The lesson was that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, Muslims were the ones who hated you and burned the American flag, so apparently Jews are on our side, because enemy of my enemy and all that.

But now we're getting into a generational divide. If you were born in the late 90s or onward, you might barely remember 9/11 or what the world was like before it. For you, Israel was just some country on the other side of the world that all your politicians felt the need to mention when trying to get your parents to vote for them, and then you looked it up and learned it was doing some bad stuff. Israel is now wealthy and powerful, and the big countries they're surrounded by aren't really enemies anymore.

Now they're just fighting small militias along its border. They're not the underdogs anymore. We see footage of Israeli soldiers, and we look at the neighbourhoods in Gaza, and suddenly it feels like Israel is the oppressor bullying the little guys. The fight has been reframed from "Israel vs. all the Arab countries" to just "Israel vs. the Palestinians", and now the Palestinians are the underdogs.

### The Arab perspective

the-kaaba.png|The Kaaba in Mecca|A photograph of Muslims at the Kaaba in Mecca.

In Western Arabia, along the eastern coast of the Red Sea, there is **Mecca**, the holiest city in Islam, birthplace of the prophet Muhammad, and location of the Kaaba, the cube-shaped Mosque that millions of Muslims make a pilgrimage to visit each year, and in whose direction all Muslims around the world face daily in prayer. For centuries, Mecca was controlled by the (non-Arab) Ottoman Empire, though often through a vassal-state called the Sharifate of Mecca. (A Sharifate means rule by a *Sharif*, a religious leader who claims to be descended from the prophet Muhammad's grandson.)

In 1908, **Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi** was appointed to be the new Sharif of Mecca. Hussein grew critical of the Ottoman Empire as the Young Turk Revolution earlier that year resulted in a party called the **Committee of Union and Progress** gaining significant power, existing alongside and eventually usurping almost all *de facto* power from the sultan. The CUP then began persecuting non-Turkish ethnic minorities as part of their goal to "Turkify" the region, leading to the Armenian genocide on order of the CUP's leader, Talaat Pasha, during which Hussein helped save thousands of Armenians.

After WWI started, Hussein learned the CUP planned on deposing him, so he sided with the Allies. Britain, meanwhile, was trying to maintain the support of the Muslim world after Mehmed V declared a holy war against them in 1914, calling on all Muslims living in Allied-controlled countries to revolt in support of the Ottomans (many did). These factors led to the *quid pro quo* in the McMahon--Hussein correspondence, and to Hussein launching the **Arab Revolt** against the Ottomans in 1916. Hussein then declared himself king of all Arab countries, though the Allies didn't accept this and recognized him only as the king of a new country called Hejaz. After the Ottoman Empire was formally dissolved in 1924, Hussein declared himself the new caliph, with the support of the now-deposed Ottoman caliph, Mehmed VI. Though he was forced to abdicate from his position the following year after being attacked by Ibn Saud (which is why Saudi Arabia controls Mecca today), Hussein still had a significant influence as the "father of pan-Arabism", and his sons became the kings of Iraq (Faisal I, r. 1921--33) and Jordan (Abdullah I, r. 1921--51).

Not all Arab states were immediately advocates of pan-Arabism (as in forming a singular Arab super-country), but they were embracing Arab unity and rejecting Western powers interfering in the Arab world. They felt betrayed by the West after Britain and the United Nations---instead of leaving and allowing the region to be controlled by the Arab forces that had just helped them overthrow the Ottomans---made it known they wanted to install a Jewish state, populated by tens of thousands of settlers from Europe, right in the heart of the Middle East. It turns out this is what they were planning even before Hussein started his revolt. The UN proposed the borders of this new Jewish state would stretch all the way down to the Gulf of Aqaba, dividing the Arab world in two. It meant you couldn't get from the Sinai to Arabia without going through Israeli territory. Muslims in Egypt, then the most powerful Arab country, would no longer be able to travel to Mecca by land without the Jews' permission.

From the Arab perspective, this was all objectionable even before any fighting started. The creation of Israel, in that location, with those borders, without any Arab states being consulted? Then when Jewish militants began attacking the Muslim community in Palestine (in 1948), and expelling thousands from their homes, creating a refugee crisis in the region, the Arab powers knew they had to react. This couldn't go on. A few years prior, in 1945, the **Arab League** had been formed, headquartered in Egypt. Its founding member-states weren't ready to surrender their sovereignty, but through the Arab League declared their intent to coöperate and strengthen their ties, and expressed jointly, through the League's charter, their dissatisfaction with the lack of independence granted to Palestine after WWI. This is why a few years later, when Israel declared its independence in 1948, all the Arab League's founding members (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Syria) attacked Israel together as a united front.

For decades, every Arab country refused to officially recognize Israel, some still don't, considering it nothing more than an illegitimate occupier of Arab land, a thorn in their side they couldn't get rid of. That's why their position was not one of compromise, but the demand that Israel be completely dissolved. Why settle for less? This only began changing a generation or so later, with the Camp David Accords in 1978, when Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with and recognize Israel, to the chagrin of their fellow Arab League members. Eventually, Palestine itself, and then Jordan, would do the same.

### Putting the Nakba in perspective

The initial grievance that still fuels the conflict today concerns the 1948 expulsion of 700,000 people from Israel, which the Arab world calls the Nakba. How do we understand this number and the scale of impact these expulsions made? It's smaller than most major cities. It's about half the size of the Bronx. It's roughly the same as the current metro populations of Leicester, England; Madison, Wisconsin; Dresden, Germany; or London, Ontario. So imagine if we kicked out every single person from one of those places. The only time this sort of thing happens in the West is when there's a natural disaster. Hurricane Katrina, the cyclone that hit the US Gulf coast in 2005, stands as the most significant example. It temporarily displaced 1.5 million people, and though most were able to return eventually, around 100,000 never did, in many cases because their homes were completely destroyed and they rebuilt their lives elsewhere. Even if 7 times that amount were permanently displaced instead, to match the Nakba in scale, it doesn't feel the same because the people displaced by Katrina who didn't return to their old towns weren't forcibly prevented from doing so if they really wanted to, nor was there a conscious entity for us to blame and hold accountable for the storm's destruction.

We could look to other population transfers that took place in the 20th century. The largest was the partition of British India, creating the modern India and Pakistan, wherein roughly 15 million people moved in one direction or the other (Muslims to Pakistan and Bangladesh, Hindus and Sikhs to India), and another million or so people died in the process, as chaos and violence erupted all across the countryside. In a case like this, it's difficult to say how many people were forced out, how many left out of fear but actually would've been fine if they stayed, and how many left voluntarily, perhaps even enthusiastically, because they wanted to be part of the other country. But it's safe to say the number of people coerced was more than zero, and this shouldn't be understood as a voluntary migration. Here again though, it still doesn't feel the same, because while many people were displaced and forced to rebuild their lives elsewhere, it was a two-street that displaced people on both sides, and it was entirely chaotic mob violence (neither government had a policy of making anyone leave anywhere), whereas the Israeli expulsions were carried out by the Israeli military.

The closest comparison with Arabs being expelled from Israel might be ethnic Germans being expelled from the rest of Central Europe after World War II, affecting an estimated 12 million people between 1944 and 1950. It happened in the same few years, and for a similar reason (people of the side who lost a war getting kicked out of the countries that defeated them). Regardless of what we choose as our comparison, a thought comes to mind: in all these other cases, nobody is still fighting about it today. And that's not surprising. Why would they be? If we did permanently expel every single person from one of the cities I mentioned earlier, I'd expect the people affected to be upset, but I wouldn't expect their great-grandchildren to still be waging war over it 80 years later. How is it possible that these people haven't built new lives elsewhere in the Middle East and moved on from all this by now?

#### Was the Nakba justified?

There are some people who say it was. They acknowledge that it was obviously terrible for the innocent people affected---but think about the situation: you're just survived a defensive a war of extermination, and you're still surrounded by countries that want to destroy you, and there's a bunch of people on your side of the border who are part of the enemy group, many of them sympathetic to the armies that want to destroy you. *Maybe* kicking a lot of them out---not killing anyone, but just forcing them out of the region, telling them to go live in the neighbouring territory that's controlled by their group instead---was a necessary step by Israelis to secure their own safety and security in the region.

They argue that a significant portion of the people who were expelled were so antagonistic to the Jewish population that many of them would've been violent, collaborators, or otherwise represented a [fifth column](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fifth_column) that would be trying to destroy Israel from the inside. This was an important consideration if Israelis were expecting the Arab states to continue waging wars against them in the future. And there was no reliable way to somehow root through the population and expel only the people who would become militant enemies in the future. In its brutal simplicity, the expulsions were a desperate act of self-preservation.

This is not something I would personally argue, but it's an angle I find worth including to note how the idea that the 1948 expulsions were a terrible tragedy and point of shame is not a consensus.

## 1948--2022

The pre-1948 history is more interesting and relevant to explore in detail to determine how you feel about the very founding of Israel as a country in the first place. The events between then and now can still be relevant, but I'm not going to go over them in as much detail. You could write a whole book about each of the following bullet points.

* After Israel was established, Jewish communities were targetted in revenge all across many Muslim countries. Today it's estimated that about 900,000 Jews fled or were expelled throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In some of these countries virtually the entire Jewish population left, with none remaining today. The majority of them resettled to Israel, though some also moved to Western countries like France and the US. This is a valuable note for understanding modern Israel: the majority of Israelis today are the descendants of these Jews who fled to Israel after its founding, not the European settlers who came in the 1920s.
* In 1951, Abdullah I, the first King of Jordan and son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca, was assassinated while visiting Jordan-occupied Jerusalem. The assassin was shot and killed instantly, but the common interpretation is that he opposed Abdullah for his being too friendly with Israel, and for annexing the West Bank after the 1948 war, despite absorbing the Palestinian population as Jordanian citizens. This wasn't the end of the conflict between Jordan and Palestine.
* In 1964, the Arab League helped to found the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (PLO). In the beginning, the PLO was a militant group that engaged in irregular violence while demanding the complete dissolution of Israel. In 1965, the political party **Fatah** was formed by Yasser Arafat and others. To this day, Fatah is the largest faction within the PLO. Arafat would become a major figure in Palestine, and by the late 80s had led the PLO to a less extreme position, trying to negotiate with rather than destroy Israel. He claimed Israel had a right to exist by 1988.

territory-captured-in-six-day-war.png|The territory Israel captured in the Six-Day War|The territory Israel captured in the Six-Day War highlighted in magenta. The southwest chunk, the Sinai Peninsula, was returned to Egypt in 1973.

* In 1967, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser said he would close the Straits of Tiran, meaning Egypt would block ships from going through the southern part of the Gulf of Aqaba, cutting off Israel from international waters. Israel said this would be a *casus belli*, and Egypt agreed, preparing their army for war as they did it anyway. The resulting conflict became known as the **Six-Day War**, in which Israel was also attacked by Jordan, Iraq, and Syria. Israel won handily, and took control of the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the whole Sinai Peninsula.
* As an aside (not directly involving Israel): after the Six-Day War, PLO militants had relocated to Jordan. In 1970, a conflict erupted called *Black September*, a civil war in which some parts of the PLO tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Jordanian monarchy. Arafat didn't appear to be the one leading the revolt (that would be other, more radical factions of the PLO), but he also didn't do much to crack down on the people who were.
* There was another war in 1973 called the **Yom Kippur War**, so called because it began with a surprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. It lasted a few weeks and as a result, Israel agreed to return control of the Sinai to Egypt, but continued its occupation of Golan, Gaza, and the West Bank.
* In 1978, the **Camp David Accords** were signed by Israel and Egypt in the United States (at Camp David), leading to another peace treaty (simply called the Egypt--Israel peace treaty) signed the following year in Washington, D.C., in which Israel agreed to withdraw from the Sinai and return it to Egypt, and Egypt recognized Israel as a legitimate state, agreed to keep the Sinai demilitarized, recognized they had no right to block Israel from going through the Gulf of Aqaba nor the Straits of Tiran, and even agreed to grant Israeli ships safe passage through the Suez canal. This treaty upset much of the Arab world. Egypt was suspended from the Arab League, of which it had been the leading member (it returned in 1989). In 1981, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat was assassinated, and the common belief is this was motivated by Islamist radicals who opposed Sadat pursuing peace with Israel and the United States.
* In 1987--91, there was a wave of protests, riots, and civil disobedience in Palestine, retroactively known as the **First Intifada** (from the Arabic for *uprising*). This drew global attention and is part of what led to the Oslo negotiations (next point).
* In 1993 and 1995, Israel and the PLO signed agreements negotiated in Oslo, Norway, called the **Oslo Accords** (Oslo I signed in America, Oslo II signed in Egypt). The PLO recognized Israel as a legitimate state, and Israel recognized the PLO as the legitimate authority representing the Palestinian people. This also resulted in the Palestine Authority being created, a semi-autonomous government to operate in Palestine. They agreed to have the West Bank split up into different zones, called Area A (fully Palestinian-controlled), Area B (Palestinian-controlled with Israeli security), and Area C (fully Israel-controlled). The United Nations Security Council also adopted Resolution 242, which required that Israel withdraw from territories, but it (deliberately) didn't say *all* territories, and didn't commit them to a specific deadline. It was more of a conceptual agreement, where acknowledging that that's something Israel should do at some point. At this point, Israel had already withdrawn from the Sinai, so that left the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.
* In 2000--05, there was another intifada, known aptly as the **Second Intifada**. This one was far more violent than the first, with significant casualties on both sides. Hamas was involved despite not yet being in power (see next point). There were over 100 suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian militant groups throughout these years. Israel responded with violent military force, tanks, and airstrikes, killing hundreds of Palestinians. Arafat was again criticized for occupying a dual role, vocally calling for peace to stay on good terms with the West but not doing as much as he could to prevent violence. In 2004, Arafat died of a stroke, at age 75. The PLO chairman since then has been Mahmoud Abbas, who negotiated an end to the intifada in 2005. Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and withdrew from the territory they had advanced into earlier in the conflict.
* In 2005, Israel fully withdrew from Gaza, leaving it to the control of the Palestine Authority, whose legislative council was controlled by Fatah. In 2006, an election was held in Gaza that resulted in a different organization, **Hamas**, winning a majority of seats. Hamas wasn't yet recognized as the radical, violent group that we know today; they campaigned on wanting less corruption. It was a surprising outcome: despite getting nearly the same number of votes as Fatah, they won twice as many seats and ended up in full control of government. A civil war then broke out in 2007 between Hamas and Fatah called the *Battle of Gaza*, in which Fatah officials were imprisoned, exiled from the region, or killed. There hasn't been an election since the one in 2006. So from 1995--2006, Palestine was united under the Palestine Authority; after 2006, Palestine has been split between the Palestine Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza.
* In 2006, there was a war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon (2006 Lebanon War).
* Israel already had some control of land crossings into Gaza, but in 2009 began a naval blockade as well. This has often been criticized for restricting more imports than it should, as Israel errs on the side of caution trying to prevent the manufacture of weapons and tunnels.
* In 2018--19, dissatisfied with the lack of progress or change of their situation, decided they wanted to start something and all got together to walk in the direction of Israel until somebody stopped them. This became known as the Great March of Return, which might've been peaceful at first, but Hamas hijacked the initiative and started trying to bomb Israelis at the border, and things escalated until Israel responded violently to put a stop to it all.

## 2022--present

Israel still controls the Golan Heights, an illegal occupation they agreed to withdraw from, but in popular discourse very few people seem to care about that.

The Gaza Strip is a densely-populated, independent region with access only to the Egyptian and Israeli borders, and to the Mediterranean Sea. Israel doesn't actively occupy Gaza, but the IDF can basically grant itself access any time it wants to do military operations there. This situation is generally described as unfair and something that needs to be addressed, but that's difficult to do while Hamas controls the region.

The West Bank is governed by the PA, but is also partly under Israeli military occupation.

**Israeli settlers** have meanwhile been randomly moving into the area to build homes and develop their own civilian communities, with the intention of laying claim to the land. Everybody recognizes this to be illegal. They do it because the West Bank is land that used to be part of the Jewish kingdom of Israel historically (they even refer to it as "Judea and Samaria", the names of biblical territories the West Bank roughly corresponds to), and they view theirselves as having an historical right to the area.

Every so often, the Israeli government uses the presence of Israelis in some part of the West Bank as justification for declaring that that land now belongs to Israel. This happened again in March 2024, when Israel declared that [another 8km<sup>2</sup> was now theirs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/22/israel-largest-west-bank-settlement-blinken-visit/).

The Israeli minister who made the announcement, Bezalel Smotrich, is a notorious far-right politician who encourages these settlements. He was born, raised, and still lives in an illegal settlement himself.

If Israel is declaring that some parts of the West Bank are henceforth part of Israel, that implies they view the rest of the West Bank as not Israel. So it's not their land currently, and what they're doing is not 'settling' so much as annexing territory they acknowledge is not theirs, while fighting to prevent the people and government who do control this territory from having international recognition, autonomy of decision-making, or doing anything to stop them. How can any of this be justified?

(And if somebody did view the West Bank as Israel, that raises other, different questions---such as, why are these people not citizens of Israel, and why do they live under different laws from everybody else? What's going on here? That view of things is not viable.)

Louis Theroux, documentary producer for the BBC, recently (April 2025) released *The Settlers*, a documentary about the Israelis creating settlements in the West Bank, which is an interesting look into their lives and motivations.

*Israel's settlements in the West Bank have all been declared illegal under international law. Many of its settlements are, however, authorized by the Israeli state. But then some of the settlements are not even authorized by the Israeli state and are illegal even by Israeli standards. These have come to be referred to as "settler outposts". That's what the term refers to if you see it used in Western media, such as when reporting on some of the [US sanctions placed on settler outposts in 2024](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/14/west-bank-settlement-sanctions-biden/).*

.*Nasser, the Egyptian president who started the Six-Day War, resigned in shame after Egypt lost. But then he came back, and they kept fighting, and then Nasser died of a heart attack. Nasser arguably had some good qualities, but he was also authoritarian, sort of crazy, definitely an antisemite, said he didn't believe the Holocaust happened, and literally distributed copies of the [Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion). Unfortunately---and not in a way that necessarily lends any legitimacy to Israel, but it's still interesting---a lot of Arabs around this time believed things like this. They were more like modern neo-Nazis than simply 'anti-colonialists'.*

.*Unrelatedly, the Six-Day War is so called because the first attack was on June 5 and the final attack was on June 10, meaning there were 6 distinct days on which fighting occurred. But this means from beginning to end, only 5 days passed. It reminds me of how we say that Jesus rose on the third day, but that means he died on Friday and rose on Sunday, two days later. It's the "third day" because we're counting the day he died, then the day after, then the day after. This difference in approach to counting days amuses me. It's like an [off-by-one error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error) in real life. I wonder if it's a regional difference and the same war would've been called the Five-Day War if it happened in Europe, because all the other wars I can think of that are named after durations (e.g. the Nine Years' War in 1688--97, the Seven Years' War in 1756--63) counted units inclusively.*

# What should we do now?

The status quo in Israel wasn't great before 2023, but our political class remained broadly supportive of Israel because they simply didn't want to take a stand on it, and instead stayed the course. It's considered a polarizing, controversial topic that's safer to avoid. But let's ignore the political calculations and simply ask, as citizens of Western countries, what should we be doing about it ideally? And the answer is that we should be a lot more critical of them.

#### If I could travel back to the 1940s:

I'm talking in hindsight here, and I don't have perfect information, but here's my read of things:

The negotiations about what to do with Mandatory Palestine didn't go on for long enough, gave too much land to the Jewish state, and other Arab countries should've had more of a seat at the table. It was officially British land, so they had no 'obligation' to do anything, but this was meddling in the Arabs' back yard, and concerned the future of a population whom we know they considered 'their people'. It would've been more responsible to work toward a better outcome than wash their hands of it and leave.

There are some people who say negotiating would've been futile because Arab leaders would never have accepted any plan at all. I don't think that's right. Sure, many people were interested in Arab unity, but if you actually sat down with Arab leaders and proposed giving Jews a bit of territory just south of Lebanon, where there's already a population of Jews living, many of them are fleeing persecution---I'd be very surprised if they were totally unsympathetic to the Jewish cause and couldn't be reasoned with at all. That's simply doesn't seem like a fair characterization of the Arab leadership.

And why did the Jewish state need so much land anyway? I once read that part of the rationale was the Jewish state was likely going to be receiving Jewish refugees and therefore wanted room to expand, but that really means they needed the whole Negev down to Aqaba? Presumably they were being so kind as to grant them access to the Indian Ocean, which is valuable for trade with Asia, but why? If we're cutting things up unnaturally for shipping access, does Lebanon get a narrow strip down that way too? If they wanted a port, they could drive across another country's land like Lebanon would have to. Or use the Suez Canal. And the Muslim state in Palestine they ended up proposing would've been noncontiguous. Who wants their country to be split in half like that?

||image-float
israel-alternate-timeline.png|What if Israel was just something like this instead?|A map of an imaginary, alternate timeline that didn't happen, showing a much smaller Israel that could've been.

I feel like a Jewish state should've just been a triangle between Haifa, Jerusalem, and north of Gaza city---and then maybe extending right at the top because that's where so a lot of the Jewish settlements already were by the time of the partition, resulting in a C-shape. Here, I'll draw a map of what I mean. Would this have worked out? I don't know. We could revise every detail. Write to Sharif Hussein, apologize about the Balfour declaration, say that you never intended to give Jewish people control of *all* of Palestine, and see if he's amenable to the Jewish cause after WWII? It feels like there were so many possibilities, and I can't help think if we could go back and play these years differently, there could've been a Jewish state without causing all this conflict.

There are some people who criticize Britain throughout this for how things turned out. They packed up and left, and what they left behind was a mess that still hasn't been resolved to this day, so blaming them is tempting. However, I can also understand the British perspective at this time being that they were trying to withdraw from this kind of imperialism around the world in general, and their position couldn't have feasibly been that this shift would be completed only after world peace had been achieved, and if they *had* stuck around and continued trying to control everything, then I'm sure we'd be looking back and criticizing them for *that* decision instead. They left imperfect situations in many places---the thinking was that these were no longer their problems to solve. We had to trust the people who lived in these places could sort things out theirselves.

I also, despite my general impression about the outcome of the UN proposal, doubt that it was the intention of the UN diplomats to fuck over and divide the Arab world.

This is behind us now, though. At this point, after so many decades, the idea you're going to reverse everything that's happened and delete Israel as it now exists has become silly. May as well talk about deporting all the Europeans from North America back to Europe so the Native Americans can have the whole continent to theirselves. Life moves on.

#### Early 2023:

At this point, I think Western countries should be rethinking our relationship with Israel if they want to maintain our support and have this cozy relationship with us. There are many troubling aspects of Israeli domestic politics. I think very lowly of their Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who seems to not even be supported by most Israelis but somehow keeps building coalitions and ending up in government. There have been corruption charges against him that he somehow evades, and then recently [he passed laws to strip power from the courts](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66258416). It resembles the kind of "democratic backsliding" that we see in other flawed democracies.

If you ever want the Israel--Palestine conflict to be resolved, then Netanyahu, and any other Israelis who oppose Palestinian statehood in any form, are a serious problem. Think about it, what do they want? To keep the Palestinians in limbo forever? That does feel like their solution at times. The only alternative would be if they're holding onto the belief that someday they'll be able to annex the West Bank and Gaza as part of Israel proper, likely after somehow getting the Palestinians to leave. For some Israelis this is all justified because god gave them the region, so it's rightfully theirs anyway. This is all terrible and Israel needs to reform and get rid of these people, because not all Israelis think this way, but the ones who do have ended up in control of too much.

It seems like we have a lot of leverage with Israel because of all the support we provide them and weapons we sell them. I say we should use this to demand the complete removal of all Israeli settlements in the West Bank, then work toward explicit statehood for the Palestine Authority, recognize them as a sovereign state and post diplomatic missions to Palestine as any other country. It's optimistic, but I'd like to believe that Israel's total withdrawal from the West Bank would quell much of the animosity toward Israel therein and be accepted as a gesture of peace.

The situation in Gaza is more challenging because of Hamas, who unlike other Palestinian leadership cannot be negotiated with. This probably requires some kind of international solution. It'd be very nice if the Arab world was willing to help, because I strongly suspect that Israel itself cannot solve the problem on its own. The region needs to be policed to prevent it from falling back into the hands of extremist militants, but I suspect the people of Gaza will not accept being ruled by Israel.

Considering the Arab world has gradually been moving in the direction of negotiating with, recognizing, or normalizing relations with Israel over the years (most recently, Bahrain and the UAE officially recognized Israel as part of the Abraham Accords), the possibility of their intervention to help solve this mess---and coming down on the side of Israel *against* Hamas---gets more realistic the more time that goes by.

There probably also needs to be a conscious initiative to change the popular narrative or messaging surrounding Israel and Jews within Palestine. For years now, Hamas has been running propaganda, including children's television programs, meant to teach young people in the region to be antisemitic. We need to elevate the voices of Palestinian leaders who see that life can get better if they accept peace, and who understand that groups like Hamas don't actually represent the interests of Palestinians. But those voices won't have any credibility if Israel doesn't do as they're predicting and actually work with them to improve the situation. If Israeli leadership refuses to give an inch and insists they will never acknowledge a Palestinian state, that's going to make peace seem futile.

We also probably need to do something about the fact these organizations are propped up by foreign money. They're not just ragtag groups of locals. The leader of Hamas hides out in Qatar, and Hamas, like other terrorist groups, benefits from funding by Iran. The leaders of Hezbollah, a Shīʿite group, also travel to and study in Iran. And of course, Iran also funds Ansar Allah, or the Houthis. Iran is effectively using these groups as a proxy force against Israel and the West. And for that purpose, it's in Iran's interest for these groups to remain extremist and uncompromising.

The silver lining of the Iran connection might be that it contributes to Saudi Arabia, and other Sunni Muslim countries that are at odds with Iran, being that much more against these terrorist groups than they would've been otherwise, and all the more likely to slide, ever so slowly, into being on Israel's side when push comes to shove. In  April 2024, when Iran was launching missiles towards Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE all helped repel Iran's missile attacks. Who'd have thought?

#### After the October 7 attacks, 2023:

I don't know if we could reasonably demand that Israel sit on their hands and do nothing at this point. Hamas has effectively declared war on them and invaded their country and killed their people. They even took many hostage, pulling them back into Gaza. The psychology of many Israelis at this moment is a demand for justice and for the rescuing of their people held captive. Even if an Israeli government were perfectly enlightened, this would be an impossible situation to ignore without causing a domestic political crisis. It's a tense situation, and something has to give.

The main concern is that Israel might drastically overstep and the result is going to be bad. Israelis have decided they're fed up with tolerating Hamas and they want the organization destroyed, and they're going to turn the entirety of Gaza over if that's what it takes. These are very frightening times.

From here, the role of Western allies of Israel should be to allow some justified military response, but ensure there's not excessive death or destruction, that things don't go too far. I'd also support setting a red line right now that they're not allowed to make any settlements in Gaza whatsoever. Let's be clear: in the event Israel does go crazy, like if they started lashing out and killing everybody in the whole region, then at some point it would be our responsibility to militarily intervene.

#### November 2024:

With the election of Donald Trump to be the next commander of the American military, I expect Israel will be given even more leeway than before. Joe Biden already wasn't particularly imposing anyway, but the situation has effectively just got much worse. Trump has no idea how to conduct foreign policy and probably doesn't even care what happens in the Middle East anyway.

Israel--Palestine has been a difficult, polarizing issue for a long time, but supporting Israel and calling them our ally has been the normal stance in US politics. To suddenly change pace and take a hard stance in the opposite direction, on something so controversial? That's a difficult thing for many politicians, for better or for worse.

#### February 2025:

In a joint presser with Netanyahu, Trump explains that Israel is going to [completely take over](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/05/trump-gaza-takeover-palestinians-israel) the Gaza strip, possibly [using the American military to do so](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/politics/netanyahu-trump-white-house-meeting/index.html). Trump says he can see the USA taking on a "long-term ownership position". Is this all talk? Is this going to happen? It's completely insane even if it doesn't go anywhere (as many Trump stories don't).

#### June 2025:

So far, the only negative pressure that Trump has put on Israel hasn't been trying to get them to be more restrained or to be more open to oversight. It's just been [to help shield Netanyahu](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxg272nlyo), publicly calling him a hero and condemning Israel's corruption charges against him as [a "witch hunt".](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/israel/trump-netanyahu-corruption-trial-witch-hunt-canceled-rcna215168)

I'm not sure what more to say at this point. The whole situation just seems terrible and hopeless so long as Trump and Netanyahu are both in office.

# Am I a Zionist?

It probably wouldn't occur to me to call myself a Zionist, because I'm not Jewish and I have no connection to their project. To me, it's just like any other national independence movement. There's currently no Kurdistan for the Kurds nor Khalistan for the Sikhs. There's a lot of independence movements going on around the world as we speak, many of them demanding separation from some larger territory they're currently a part of. And there's no general answer to which ones ought to succeed. It would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. A group of people need to organize, engage in diplomacy, and make their case for independence. Is there a need and demand for it? In the cases where a group suceeds, I'm fine with it. If the Kurds got their own state, then I wouldn't oppose it and I'd wish them good luck. But I wouldn't call myself a Kurdish nationalist, or a Sikh nationalist, or anything else, because I'm not a member of those groups nor am I doing anything to make their goals happen. I'm just an outside observer who's aware of their movements.

I gather that "Zionist" was first applied to non-Jews because there were Christians who supported the Jewish cause for their own reasons (i.e. a belief that Jewish people returning to the promised land of Israel was part of a prophecy related to the foretold return of Christ). And perhaps that opened the door to *anybody* who feels supportive of Israel being called a Zionist, even though Zionism itself is a secular movement (and is at odds with orthodox religious Judaism). Only in that broadest possible sense could I accept being called a Zionist, because I welcome a Jewish state existing as such---and now that one exists, I don't support its destruction.

Though Zionism has no personal, ideological, or religious importance to me, my feelings about it are more developed than a random, *abstract* independence movement. In the context of post-war Europe, Jews' lack of trust in being governed by another people certainly appears to have merit. And Jews feels closer to home for many of us than other groups around the world, due to their religious similarities with Christians, and the fact they've been with us for so long and have contributed so much to our civilization. I don't know any Jews personally, but I think we all at least know *of* some Jewish author, musician, entertainer, scientist, politician, or philosopher. They've also endured hardships, often inflicted by us, for which we feel some guilt or shame. It may even feel like we owe them. For these reasons, Zionism could win a neutral white Briton's support more readily than some other independence movement chosen at random.

In that sense, too, I could join many others in my society in offering the Jewish cause my sympathy and blessing, and---if that is what a person means by "Zionist"---then I invite their condemnation. I say *condemnation* because I've only ever been asked whether I'm a Zionist by people who are very much anti-Israel and hoping that I say no. It's given as a test, of sorts, where no is the "correct" answer, and if you say yes, they act like you've just admitted to something terrible. This is one way that anti-Zionists try to apply social pressure, to make otherwise neutral, unknowledgeable parties feel as though they ought to denounce the very notion of Jewish autonomy. I resent this. There is nothing wrong with being a Zionist. [Say it with me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmVeTtlJvJQ)

This is worth saying and repeating because there are people who would like to shift the meaning of Zionism to something innately negative---intolerable, even. The most absurd people go so far as to say Zionism is a "Nazi ideology"---a rather disgusting smear to throw at the *actual* victims of Nazi atrocities, as much as the irony may be intended. Their rationale is as simple as that Jewish people want a Jewish-majority state. Is the implication that all the Nazis wanted was a German majority, something they already had, and nothing more? Is the implication that Jewish people cannot wield political autonomy without becoming Nazis? Why would that be? What special quality do they have that separates them from all other peoples in this regard? The framing is as offensive as it is stupid.

Less obvious are those who stop at saying Zionism entails a desire for violence, ethnic cleansing, genocide, or some other terrible thing---as though Jews have some kind of special gene that turns them into monsters whenever they're *not* a persecuted minority, and ergo we must prevent them from having the political autonomy that most other peoples enjoy. It's challenging for such "anti-Zionism" to exist independently from its obvious antisemitic overtones, because there is no serious basis for the distinction. Only when Jewish people are the majority do we suddenly need to litigate whether it might be *problematic* to have a region in which you're the majority. In their mind, Jewish people are still that little group at the edge of town whom we can blame for our problems. And there they want the Jew to remain. Back to the ghettos with you, Israelis.

If I were Jewish, I would be very cautious about people who participate in this selective skepticism. And I'd have no tolerance for people who make this demand, that Jewish people must surrender their state to become a minority in the Middle East, to be ruled by a Muslim majority that's currently waging war against them. I should sooner prepare for war than submit to that. As it stands, "Zionist" is a broad label that applies to people with right-wing and left-wing views, who have all sorts of positions about how Israel ought to be governed, how it ought to behave internationally, and what ought to be done about their conflict with Arab states and with the Palestinian population. If I were a Zionist, I might be considered a left-wing Zionist who's critical of what Israel is doing---but I would still be a Zionist so long as I'm not in favour of the country being dismantled. In that sense, in a saner political landscape, "anti-Zionist" would be the unreasonable, and often extremist, position that should be interrogated.

# Is Palestinian an ethnicity?

What *is* a Palestinian, exactly? In the simplest sense, it's a person who lives in the region. But is that an ethnicity, or just a demonym? That is, a term for the residents of someplace, like calling a person who lives in Chicago a Chicagoan. The people of Chicago might call theirselves that, some even may identify that way, but we don't consider "Chicagoan" to be an ethnic group.

I think a decade before the Balfour declaration, nobody in Palestine identified very strongly as a "Palestinian". They were all citizens of the Ottoman Empire, but there generally wasn't a very strong "Ottoman identity" either. In most places within the empire, the strongest form of identity at the time was religious affiliation, or very local family and clan ties.

That started to change after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, when the region became a separate territory called Mandatory Palestine, and European Jews began showing up and buying land in the area. If you were a Muslim living in the area, your status as a 'Palestinian' was suddenly being emphasized---*and* there were outsiders to distinguish yourself *against*. Then there were a couple decades of minor conflict between groups, further emphasizing the difference therebetween. Then after the 1948 expulsions, the shared experience of being forced out of their homes and living as refugees with no proper political agency for a couple generations would make them distinct if they weren't before. They had a narrative, a story, a feeling of unity and solidarity, and a political reason to emphasize and insist upon their ethnic distinctness.

In conclusion, sure, it is arguably an ethnicity---despite it emerging for political reasons, and relatively recently in history. It reminds me of the distinction between American black people who are the descendants of American slaves, as opposed to black people who are not (though unlike 'Palestinian', I don't believe that distinction was ever enough a part of black people's social consciousness to be considered an ethnicity---there was just the idea of this distinction).

However, the only reason this question seems to matter is for how the notion of "Palestinian" being a distinct ethnic group makes the act of "expelling them from their ancestral villages in Palestine" sound like an even worse action than it would've been otherwise. Put differently, it creates the implication of some special connection between that group of people and this chunk of land. If that's something you find persuasive, and we're giving special attention to land claims that accompany unique social identities, that still doesn't exactly work if we're conceding the identity in question emerged after or around the same time as those expulsions, and perhaps largely *in response* to the act of expulsion.

# Terrorism isn't unique to any population

I feel it's important to remember that no population is perfectly good. The depravity of Hamas is not a defect of their ethnicity, nor their religion, nor any other innate quality of theirs. We're better people than they are because the generations before us managed to create peaceful, orderly societies, and we all had the privilege of growing up in that bubble of protection, learning about its virtues, having stable institutions to rely on, learning and internalizing good behaviour. If all that collapsed, things would change, and some among us would reveal just how bad they can be.

In any sufficiently large population, there is a diverse range of psychologies, including people who are more willing than average to step on puppies. In Nazi Germany, who do you think guarded the camps? They didn't have to breed those Germans in a lab. They already existed among that population. If a dictatorship arose in any given country, there's going to be some percentage of people who turn out to support it. And if your country *doesn't* fall to dictatorship, those people will probably just carry on living normal lives, their potential for horrific action never being realized or activated without a certain environment to trigger it. They walk among us.

Haven't you ever met someone like this? I encounter them sometimes---a person about whom I later think, "If we lived in Nazi Germany, this guy might've worked at Dachau", or "If we lived in Nazi Germany, this guy would've ratted on his neighbours if they were were hiding Jewish children". It doesn't mean he's destined to become a serial killer in this life (maybe he'll get a job at Fox News or something instead), but if the stars did align and he were called to action, he'd shrug and pull the trigger. And if he were born in a different part of the world, he might yell "allahu akbar" before he does.

I can imagine if my city were annexed by another country, that ruled over us in a way everybody thought was unjust, and it went on for a long time, and we couldn't overpower this enemy through conventional means, and no other country or power intended to intervene. At some point, the people around me would become guerilla fighters, they would start militias, they would engage in irregular and unconventional warfare. They would probably be declared terrorists or something. And in those circumstances, the would-be psychopaths who walk among us might be of use. They might activate their potential to shrug and pull the trigger but channel it entirely toward this oppressive enemy. That is, in general, how I interpret extremist terror groups in other societies: not a reflection of that whole population being terrible, but of the fact something has gone dearly wrong, and the psychological underclass of that society has been able to float to the top and take things over.

Don't think it couldn't happen here. That was the great lesson of Nazi Germany, don't you think?

*However...*

Not all armed resistance groups throw their morality out the window. And even among groups willing to do immoral things if that's what it takes to win, some are worse than others. The depths of cruelty and immorality that we see in some terrorist groups today was not an inevitability. They aren't dominoes with no agency. Their depravity is the result of choices they made, and which they could've made differently.

Palestinians, in general, deserve your empathy for wanting to fight. But the way in which some of these groups, like Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Houthis act is not something you should feel any need to justify or make excuses for, any more than you would for the Nazi leadership. They, too, had a narrative about how they'd been pushed around and treated unfairly by larger powers. Do we say they couldn't help theirselves, and the Treaty of Versailles made them do it?

Just because you consider yourself the victim doesn't mean you can't also become the villain. Perhaps that guy who beats his wife was bullied as a child. Everybody has a story for why they are the way they are. And feeling like everything you do is justified in your pursuit of vengeance is a dangerous mentality---but a powerful one, when it can be harnessed in the service of evil.

.When I say "groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Houthis", it's because there are indeed other, smaller groups that are similarly despicable. These three are the ones always mentioned because they're the largest in their respective region. In Gaza, for example, there is also the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose paramilitary segment is known as the Al-Quds Brigade.

# Israel and left-wing radicalization

Israel has been losing ground in the court of public opinion recently. The common perception is their military is inflicting too much destruction on too many people, with too little regard for civilian casualties or for disrupting people's lives, effectively expelling people from an area and then blowing it up so there's nothing to go back to. What you think about Israel has consequently become a top priority for many left-wing people. They use it as though a litmus test to distinguish good from evil, and they denounce anybody who falls short of the most extreme, anti-Israel positions. This is a problem.

The 'alternative' news and media ecosystem on the internet has been increasingly manipulated by organized propaganda campaigns---whether a state-affiliated bot farm or an organic, but nonetheless organized, emergent community of people with a shared message they want to proselytize.

There are young people today getting all their information about the world from social media who don't realize how much anti-Israel bias they're surrounded by. It's become normal to them. There are whole networks of people who go around pushing 'anti-Zionist' views in every comment section across TikTok, Reddit, Quora, Twitter, Youtube---you name it, and there's a group-chat somewhere dedicated to brigading it, trying to control the narrative and reframe how *you* think about what you're seeing.

And it doesn't stop with Israel. There's a whole radicalization pipeline that tries to pull people in a far-left, anti-Western direction, using Israel as its starting point---kind of like how there's also an organized far-right that tries to pull people in for radicalization starting with, say, not like censorship in video games, or thinking that divorce is unfair to men sometimes. Even if you fully condemn Israel (or censorship in video games for that matter), there is something nefarious about the way this discourse is taking place, and there are serious problems with where many people are ending up when they come the other side.

Even when it pertains to things I agree with, I often resent group-identity meta-politics where everybody is pressured into adopting the latest *correct opinion* on penalty of exile. This reduces the expression of that opinion into a superficial performance---"look at me everybody, I'm saying the thing I'm supposed to say!"---and it increases the danger of **purity spiralling**, i.e. people trying to one-up each other in their enthusiasm and zealotry for the cause, because it's socially rewarding in such an environment to do so. It's like wanting to be the biggest fan in the fan club.

Purity spiralling is how people go from "Israel is doing something bad that we should oppose", to "Israel has no 'right to exist' and should be destroyed", to "every Jewish person in Israel is a valid military target for the brave Hamas freedom fighters". After some point, you've lost the plot and just become a total crazy person.

I need to be direct here. In my experience, **the way many left-wing communities act when it comes to Israel is unthinking and cult-like**, treating the whole conflict as black-and-white, morally uncomplicated, lacking in any nuance, offering no room for disagreement or compromise---anybody who would dare to disagree is simply outcast as evil, and therefore doesn't need to be compromised with. They speak about the issue with absolute moral conviction and self-righteousness. They're also very **controlling about language**, requiring that everybody they talk to does so only on their terms, by their definitions, conceding to all the labels and framing that they insist upon. Even just disagreeing about the language---e.g. if they say Israel is engaging in "apartheid" and you don't think that's an apt description---is often enough to be outcast as evil. They *will* die on any one of these hills.

And they sympathize with actual terrorist groups. They lionize them as resistance fighters. They make excuses for terrorist attacks. There are many far-leftists who will argue the October 7 attacks were justified, or, short of that, refuse to condemn any of it. They recognize the injustice of the Nakba, but the persecution of Jews doesn't concern them. They see how the conditions in which Palestinians are born and raised contributes to radicalization and violence, but don't expect any honest analysis of what motivates Jews to have the feelings and priorities they do.

Then they begin turning on each other. Even the most progressive, left-wing politicians---Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and now Zohran Mamdani---have all been confronted and denounced by insatiable left-wingers who felt their positions on Israel--Palestine just weren't extreme enough.

I've made a similar criticism in the past about LGBT politics, where I often agreed with the claim in dispute---e.g. "trans women are women", or at least should be treated like women for the most part; or "trans women should be able to use female washrooms"; or other reasonable stances like these---but I wouldn't support using agreement with such a claim as our dividing line between good and evil. There were people who had what I consider stupid or mistaken positions on those questions, but who were decent people with reasonable opinions otherwise.

Nor was I comfortable with how intolerant people had become to disagreement. The MO shifted from asking for acceptance, to "agree with the following claims or you're banned". It resulted in some people being unfairly maligned and alienated who shouldn't have been, and it resulted in purity spiralling toward ever more radical positions, and it resulted in community spaces that were paradoxically unwelcoming because it was so easy to make a small mistake and get kicked out over it that everybody had to walk on eggshells the whole time they were there.

This is one part of what motivates me to talk about Israel--Palestine: the extent to which it feels like the discourse around it has been hijacked by an angry mob, polarizing everybody into one of two camps (pressuring anyone who starts off with a reasonable criticism of Israel into adopting increasingly extremist policies, while greatly overstating the wickedness of moderate people on the other side), purity-spiralling itself into supporting terrorism, and fixating on just this one issue in a way that harms every left-leaning political party. Which, in the age of right-wing insanity, is a high price to pay.

We need more people who can be 'anti-Israel' without being so terrified of disagreeing with the most radical left-wing positions.

# Analysis of Israel

## Is Israel a settler colony?

This claim is interesting. First, what do these words even mean?

* A **settler** is somebody who moves from one place to another, and *settles* down in the new place, making that their new home.
* If you have a country, and some of your people leave and go make a home somewhere else outside your country, but they're still under your country's authority in some way, as opposed to founding a new independent country that has nothing to do with you, then we call that settlement your **colony**.

When people from Norway first travelled to Iceland and built camps there, those people were settlers. In the cases where a settlement was still under the authority of the place they came from, these settlements would've been called colonies.

When British and French explorers created the settlements that would eventually become modern Canada, they were settlers, and the cities they created were colonies.

If we Earthlings ever create a permanent base on the moon or on Mars, it would be a colony, and people who live there full-time might be called settlers.

There are some people who use "settler colonialist" as a term for something bad---but there's nothing inherently wrong with settling, nor with having a colony. The badness typically comes later: if settlers in a colony do something bad to people they encounter.

Israel undisputedly had settlers, but calling it 'colonialist' doesn't make as much sense. What was Israel a colony of? There was no other Jewish country. They had no homeland to go back to. For Jews, this *was* their homeland. That's why they stayed and fought through such hardship.

A better claim could be that Israel was the *product* of colonialism, in the sense that it's an entity created by the United Nations on conquered territory of the British Empire, but again there is no homeland they're fighting on behalf of or being controlled by. Functionally speaking, for Jews, Israel became their homeland. Perhaps 'imperialist' would fit better, since all of the borders and movement in the area were controlled by empires (Ottoman, British, arguably other states as well---we'd have to quibble about at what point a supre-national entity becomes an 'empire'). And that's true: Israel was created by the machinations of empires and is therefore, if indirectly, a product of their imperialism; but this becomes so watered down as to be uninteresting. Everything in this region is the product of some imperialism or another. That's how the world was back then, and what led to Arabs and Muslims controlling all the territory they do.

So, verdict: true, but not much of a condemnation, and often used for its misleading implications.

## Is Israel an apartheid state?

The term 'apartheid' comes from South Africa (roughly 'apartness'). It described their race-based caste system, in which what race you were considered would determine what job you could have, what school you could attend (and what they'd teach at your school), what districts you could live in, and even where in public you could go. There were different beaches, hospitals, post offices---*everything* was segregated by race. This is fairly a unique thing in history; the only other society that came close was the Southern United States pre-1965, when state and local 'Jim Crow' laws enforced race-based segregation of certain public things---but even that was moderate compared to apartheid.

There's nothing remotely like this in Israel. There's no segregation, and there's no laws or policies based on race or religion. And the purpose of apartheid in South Africa was keeping the white population in power socially and politically, despite their only being a small minority of the country (about 7 percent). In Israel, Jewish people are the vast majority (over 70 percent). Why would Jews need special laws to keep theirselves in power when they're already the vast majority of the population? Nothing about this comparison makes sense.

When people say that Israel is "doing apartheid", the strong claim isn't about Israel, but about what Israel is imposing onto some parts of the West Bank, where the IDF treats Israeli citizens differently from non-citizens. That's true, but the distinction isn't based on race or religion. By this reasoning, seemingly all military occupation would be considered apartheid. We could say that the Allied forces imposed apartheid on Germany in WWII. The US imposed apartheid on Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, and so on. Perhaps we could also say a military base is itself doing apartheid because soldiers are treated differently from civilians, and a prison is doing apartheid because prisoners are treated differently from non-prisoners. It's an absurd path to go down because apartheid is supposed to mean a system of racial domination, not just any time two people are treated differently.

The idea that it makes any sense to call Israel an apartheid state was granted a veneer legitimacy in 2021 when an Israeli human rights organization called B'Tselem was proudly declaring it one in headlines everywhere---but if you read past the headlines, the distinction they were talking about wasn't race or religion, it was Israeli citizenship status. And it wasn't in Israel, but only in the West Bank. It was all rather carefully worded, as though run by lawyers, to be as misleading and as rhetorically effective as possible without strictly being false.

Look, for example, at [this article published in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/12/israel-largest-human-rights-group-apartheid) by Hagai El-Ad, B'Tselem's director, titled "We are Israel's largest human rights group and we are calling this apartheid". I'm sure emphasizing the fact their organization is located in Israel made this appear far more credible than it really is. Notice, first of all, how the title of the article sounds like he's saying Israel is an apartheid state, but carefully doesn't say that explicitly. It only says "this" is apartheid, where *this* is an ambiguous pronoun (it refers to *something* not yet stated). It could've said "we are calling this apartheid" and then you open the article and it's talking about a conflict in Brazil.

In the article, El-Ad quickly broadens the scope of his claims to "Israel-Palestine", talking about the combination of these regions as though a singular entity (which is going to be misleading for the average reader), and says "half of those living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea are Palestinian". That's because a large portion of the land between the river and the sea isn't Israel. This would be like if we were condemning France, and then said "half of the people who live between the Loire and the Rhine have no power in the French government". A large portion of what's between the Loire and the Rhine is Germany. This tricky language is all deliberate.

Later, he remarks at how "there is demographic parity between the two peoples living here", and yet "life is managed so that only one half enjoy the vast majority of political power". That's again true, but only because the "here" he's referring to still isn't Israel, but Israel *and* something *outside of* Israel.

El-Ad tacitly acknowledges the obvious truth that Israel has none of the features of apartheid---but twists himself into using the term anyway by calling it "our version" and "apartheid 2.0", thus granting the term significant leeway by implying a departure from its conventional implications. This notion---the idea that, that "*okay, fine*, it's not like South African apartheid, but it's a "modern form of" apartheid", or "apartheid for the 21st century"---isn't unique to the article nor to B'Tselem. It's effective rhetoric because it's tricky to disprove, because suddenly pointing out all the differences between apartheid and Israeli policy can be shrugged off by saying "well sure, they're not *exactly* the same---that's why it's 2.0!" You wouldn't expect Toy Story 2 to just be a repeat of the first movie, would you?

For one thing to be another "version" of a first thing generally requires there to be a direct inheritance or some kind of identifiable throughline. There must be a relevant connection we agree is essential or defining about the first thing which carries on into the second, otherwise we could just call any random thing the "2.0 of" anything else, and the assertion is as baseless as it is unfalsifiable.

For comparison, I'll consider two examples where a thing has been "updated" and where I do accept it makes sense to refer to the new version by the same name as the old one, despite the change in form.

* **Slavery**. In the past, slavery often took the form of *de jure* property ownership of another person. You are my slave, I own you, you are my property, that's the law. That's generally not how it works anymore today, but we still use the language of 'slavery', either making a distinction by calling the slavery which occurs today 'modern slavery' or distinguishing historical forms of slavery that involved *de jure* ownership of persons by calling that 'chattel slavery'.
The difference is that chattel slavery is now broadly illegal, but some people are still effectively forced to work because they've been trapped in circumstances where there's no other options, and are often physically threatened to prevent them from leaving. This is sometimes a criminal operation that has to operate in the shadows, evading law enforcement; but in some cases it's done by the state, like in North Korea.
These are two different *forms* of the same underlying thing, in terms of the intent of the people doing it (pursuit of unethical, cheap labour) and the effect it has on its targets (forcing you to do labour you don't want to do in a situation you can't leave voluntarily). And there is a connection in terms of *which* people are doing it, in the sense I'm willing to say the same people who engage in modern slavery may well have been engaging in chattel slavery instead if it weren't currently illegal. They *resort* to modern slavery.
* **Nazism**, which now often takes the form of **neo-Nazism**. The criteria for calling somebody a Nazi in 1943 was rather specific: they supported Nazi Germany, or they adhered to the Nazi ideology, which culminated in, at least, support for dictatorship and trying to exterminate people they deemed inferior, from the disabled to the race-lessers to the homoseks.
What makes somebody a neo-Nazi, on the other hand, is less precise because the 'neo-' prefix implies a reëmergence of something in an altered form, but doesn't specify the nature of said alterations. Part of how you can understand it is by tracing the evolution of ideas over time within the same organizations, by the same authors throughout their lives, or as ideas were passed down by writers influencing one another between generations, to see how the application of their underlying goals, principles, and attitudes responded to the changing political landscape (a similar kind of genealogy can be used to understand other movements, e.g. feminism, communism). They found the original Nazism appealing, but thought it had to be reformed to be more palatable after the post-war consensus. Today they make different arguments, appealing to different things, but maintain an undercurrent of authoritarianism and a desire for racial separatism.

When I say Israel isn't an apartheid state, it's not because I went searching for any kind of surface-level difference between Israel and South Africa to dismiss the idea. I understand how the spirit of an idea can be transposed between circumstances in complex ways. The problem is that I'm unable to make a similar analysis about Israel. There needs to be some kind of core, essential, underlying theme, attitude, idea, philosophy, or a continuity of relations or influence, a passing down of a torch, a nod of inspiration---*something* that allows us to draw a line from one to the other. And in this case, there just isn't.

The laws that made up the apartheid system in South Africa were implemented around the same time as Israel was founded. The apartheid system and Israel then coëxisted from the 1940s to the 1990s, when apartheid was abolished. There is no serious parallel here. I would never have even thought to make such a baseless comparison if it weren't being used in anti-Zionist messaging to attack Israel---which is probably done purely because they realized the apartheid comparison plays well with a white, Western audience who became sensitive about anti-black racism after the 1960s.

The one concrete policy that some people point to in trying to make the apartheid argument is the fact it's easier for people of Jewish ancestry to become new citizens than those who aren't. This is an absurdly low bar to call something apartheid. Jewish people live as a diaspora throughout much of the world. Now as there's finally a country where Jews have a stable population, they're not allowed to offer their own people an easier time if they come home? And if they do, we point and call that a horrific system of racial domination? It's easier to get citizenship in numerous other countries if you can show that you have ancestry from there, most famously Ireland but other European countries as well. And last I checked, nobody calls them ethno-states or accuses them of being racial supremacists because of this.

Interestingly, there's also a country in Africa called Ghana, which offers to settle anybody with African ancestry, and has made specific efforts to invite African-Americans to become citizens. Is that black supremacy? Are they doing apartheid? No, nobody cares. It's only bad when Jews do it.

## Is Israel an ethno-state?

This isn't a traditional political term. It was first thrust into our political lexicon by a white nationalist named Richard Spencer, who used it to describe his desire to expel non-white people from sections of the United States in order to create a region not only of a white majority, but where *only* white people would even be allowed to live or be citizens.

If we take 'ethno-state' to mean *that*, then Israel obviously isn't one and never has been. But there are people out there who equivocate between this and a much softer meaning that one could assign to the term, which is simply a region where a certain ethnic group is the majority, or where the state has been designed or planned in such a way so as to achieve that outcome. This describes many other countries, perhaps most countries. Scotland is an ethno-state by this standard. Who cares?

This is a propaganda tactic: they use language associated with racism to harness how you feel about that, then try to redirect those feelings and point them toward Israel, hoping you don't notice the sneaky way they've abused the language.

## Is Israel engaging in ethnic cleansing?

This often refers to the hypothetical in which people are forced out of the Gaza strip. The most obvious problem with calling that ethnic cleansing is they have people of the same ethnicity in their country whom they're not trying to get rid of. So is it really a campaign against that ethnic group?

Imagine going back to the Ottoman Empire and there were Armenians in significant number all throughout the country, but in one specific province, that had an Armenian majority, there were gangs or paramilitary groups that had gained control and were fighting against the government. If the Ottomans responded by kicking every single Armenian person out of the country, that's ethnic cleansing. They're removing a whole ethnicity from the region. But what if they just kicked out everybody from that one province where gang violence was a big problem, and Armenians elsewhere in the country were left alone? I'd have a hard time calling that ethnic cleansing. And what if they also kicked out all the non-Armienians from that region too? Then it's definitely not ethnic cleansing, right?

In the worst case scenario, if Israel decided to push every single person out of Gaza, whether you call that ethnic cleansing is a little unclear and I suppose will depend on how you interpret that language. In my opinion it doesn't capture the spirit of the term, which is about trying to change the demographics of your society by expelling certain ethnic groups. And Israel isn't even doing that. So I don't understand why this needs to be pushed into 'ethnic cleansing' territory instead of just being considered a political conflict. It should be sufficient to say that I'm against expelling people from territory. Forced "population transfers" aren't a way of the world anymore, and good riddance.

Say, if the United States were to deport a large number of illegal immigrants, and most of them ended up being Mexican nationals, is that ethnic cleansing? Even though ethnicity isn't the criteria that's used to determine whether a person gets deported or not? If intentions don't matter, all these categories get weird when you try to apply them. You start catching a lot of things in your net that you wouldn't have wanted to.

## Is Israel committing genocide?

The term 'genocide' has important legal and political implications, which is why politicians often avoid it, even if they're critical of what Israel is doing. The moment they utter it, they would be triggering a different type of conversation. The rest of us are not so burdened, however, and in conversation 'genocide' is used far more loosely, as though a general term for a mass killing. The proper term would be 'massacre'. It isn't new for people to disagree about how to most accurately label a mass death event. For example, at the end of the Bosnian war in 1995, there was a mass killing of 8,000 Bosniak men and boys in what's called the Srebrenica Massacre. Was this a genocide? The mainstream answer is yes, but some people said no, most famously Noam Chomsky. For that, some people called him a 'genocide denier', which is misleading because he wasn't denying any of the events that happened; he only disagreed about whether it's accurate to bust out the G-word. <!-- Srebrenica = ssReh-bre-neet-tsa -->

For most people, "what is a genocide?" is an uninteresting question because it's not something they feel needs to be defined strictly or used carefully. It's about the spirit of the word, and perhaps the quantity of people dying. "Is Israel killing *a lot* of Palestinians? If so, then it's a genocide of Palestinians." That's about the level we're operating on here. Nor would people who feel strongly about the matter care to argue about the grey area. They would not change their mind about the conflict if it were somehow found that Israel's actions are similar to genocide but *technically* not, or *almost* genocide but not quite. It would still be close enough, and you would likely be judged for bothering to quibble about where exactly the line is drawn.

A response to 'genocide' being used loosely is asking about how it would apply to other things. This can help suss out what both parties intend by the term. In WWII, a lot of Germans were killed, and then nuclear bombs were dropped on Japan. Were those genocides? There are some people who say yes, which is interesting, but that indicates they're using the word differently from normal, and introduces a problem, which is that most people consider those attacks justified, and "justified genocide" is a category that should be impossible. The (rhetorical) point of using the word genocide, after all, is to remove that possibility. It's supposed to refer to something that *cannot* be justified. A differentiator might be that Germany and Japan were military threats to us, which therefore made killing their people justified, if unfortunate. We could then clarify genocide is not simply a mass killing, but an unjustified mass killing.

But then isn't Israel under military threat? Do they not have a justification to retaliate against a country that attacks them? The conversation thus moves to whether what Israel is doing is justified, or rather *how much* of what it's doing is justified. (The genocide case against Israel among international organizations in Europe concedes that Israel is taking justified military action against Hamas, but alleges they're *also* going above and beyond that to do unjustified destruction to the Gazan population that could be characterized as genocidal. It's not reasonable to say no military action was justified whatsoever.)

In comparison with the WWII examples, the focus is often the military--technological power disparity between the two sides. Hamas is probably not truly an existential threat in the same way that Nazi Germany was, and retaliation against them is thus perceived as less justified, like an adult punching a child in the face because the child punched first. I'm actually not sure if it's true that Germany or Japan could've wholly destroyed Allied countries if they wanted to. That framing would be upsetting for Israelis whose families were killed by the 'child' in question, but is still how many anti-Zionists perceive the conflict in the big picture. However, with all this being said, I wouldn't concede that a war with a less-powerful foe in which a lot of their people die is a genocide. The word entails more than that.

An expansive sense of genocide has long been that it doesn't need to apply to a *genetic* group (as the word may seem to imply, coming from *génos* + *-cide*, meaning race or tribe death), but to any discernible social identity. (Side note: an 'ethnicity' is not strictly a genetic cluster either, even though it usually is, and this is often how it's used. An ethnicity is just a shared distinction, meaning it could be a cultural, religious, linguistic, or experiential distinction. If a tribe of people of the same race splits in half, some travelling west and some travelling east, it's possible that only one generation later we'd consider these different ethnicities.) Let me simplify this into common English: a *genocidal mindset* is when a person says, "Hey, you know what? To hell with this other group of people. I want them gone. I want them to disappear, so the world no longer has to deal with their kind." And when people act on such a mindset, by trying to make it so the group in question exists no longer, that's a genocidal action.

Let's say the group in question were Buddhists and the mechanism of accomplishing this 'disappearance' were for us to outlaw all aspects of Buddhist culture. We destroy their temples, burn their books, take out their leaders, outlaw the specific clothing they often wear---to a point where 'Buddhist' as an identifiable sort of person has disappeared from society. At the very least, one should consider this very similar to genocide, and if Buddhists *were* a genetic group, then the sort of people who would perpetrate something like this may well have tried to end their genetic lineage as well, since the goal was the group's elimination. It only wasn't necessary here because they could make the group disappear through other means.

The term **cultural genocide** is used for situations like this, where a society doesn't kill or sterilize every member of a group (the most literal sense of genocide), but forcibly eliminates the social markers associated with their identity and thus forcibly assimilates them into the majority. They allow the individuals to live, but remove the group identity from those individuals, ergo the group is still removed from society. It's comparable, conceptually, to removing a building through demolition versus removing it through careful disassembly of every screw, beam, and panel, allowing us to recover and repurpose each one as a building material. Either way, the end result is the building, as such, is gone.

This is the sense in which it's coherent to speak of a 'transgender genocide'---not to mean the mass murder of trans people, but the creation of social rules, in a society where 'trans people' is an existing social identity, that makes it impossible for that identity to continue existing, and which are pushed by people who have a 'genocidal mindset' with respect to trans people (i.e. they hate trans people and want them to all disappear from society, to never be seen or heard from again). This is what was being expressed by the right-wing propagandist Michael Knowles in 2023 when he said that he wanted to "eradicate transgenderism from society". If trans people *were* a genetic group, and could therefore be eliminated forever by getting rid of all current members, people like this would be trying to figure out how to make that happen.

The question I've been leading up to is this: does Israel have genocidal intent? No, I don't think so. I haven't been persuaded to think the Israeli legislature, government, or military are operating in pursuit of eliminating the Palestinian people, nor that a significant part of the Israeli public would ever support or tolerate such a thing if it were to be attempted. That's why, although I'm personally rather critical of Israel, I don't refer to anything Israel has done as genocidal. And I feel that bringing this term into the mix is generally not a good idea.

I realize if you walk around outside in a large Israeli city, you could find some random people who've come to hate the Palestinians, who say they're all terrorists, or who flippantly say they wouldn't care if Israel just wiped them all out already to get this conflict over with. Israel has over 9 million people, so of course some of them have crazy views. The same can be said about our countries. If you walk around New York City for long enough, you'll eventually pass both Nazis and Communists who advocate for an authoritarian state to murder the other. Not everybody *in* a society is a good representation *of* that society.

And we can understand why some of those people exist, not just in Israel--Paleine but any region like this where two groups have been in conflict for so long. There are surely similar people in Palestine, who've just come to hate the Jews and say they'd wipe them all out if they could. In both of these regions, there are people who were born and raised into the conflict, who've had to fear for their lives, who've lost family members to violence by the other side, and some of them have been conditioned from a young age to fear and dehumanize the other. It's unfortunate, but the nature of this conflict has led some people to hateful, extreme, and callous attitudes. But the person who would say "let's kill them all" and mean it definitely isn't the majority, it's not a common perspective, and it's not the people who are actually in charge of things. Well, at least not in Israel. The same can't be said as safely about regions controlled by extremist groups, who don't have to do anything democratically.

And no, I'm not persuaded by Yoav Gallant (Israel's defense minister in 2022-24) calling Hamas 'animals' in the aftermath of them invading his country to brutally murder and rape civilians and their whole families. It was an improper thing to say under normal circumstances, of course---you generally don't want politicians talking that way---but these weren't normal circumstances. He had a very good and extraordinary reason to be upset, and in that context, I'm surprised he didn't say something even worse. I can't believe how many people overreact to what Jewish politicians say in the days after their country endures being attacked like this. It was October 9th.

In general, the goal of Israel, of most Israelis, is simply for the country to exist in the form it's already in, and perhaps, by extension, to eliminate the terrorist groups that are a constant threat to them. It doesn't seem like they want to eliminate any particular people-group. The reason conflict keeps happening is that neighbouring states have a dispute about Israel's legitimacy in the territory it was founded on, and therefore keep starting wars with them. And Israel has had no shyness about going to war when it's dragged into one.

### The genocide conspiracy theory

For some people, the hypothesis that Israel is acting with genocidal intent has evolved into what deserves to be called a conspiracy theory. It asserts that Jews have been engaged in a generations-long, covert operation to slowly, but surely, commit genocide with the entire world watching, but in a way that can never be clearly proved and thus evades reasonable condemnation. Every so often a Jewish politician will lash out and say something that's taken as confirmation of the plot, but it's otherwise covered up.

If you skip over the part where you have to justify this and instead simply *assume* it to be true, there's nothing you can't explain away, because everything that doesn't support or which conflicts with this interpretation of events is dismissed as Jews cleverly doing things you wouldn't expect in order to create plausible deniability for theirselves---while everything that *could* support it is taken as evidence, even where there's other, more reasonable interpretations of the facts in question (e.g. if Israel bombs a building, some people will just say "Israel is bombing this building, so they must be doing so out of genocidal intent", and take that as confirmation of their beliefs---instead of considering other, often more credible, reasons they could be bombing a building).

Like other conspiracy theories, it's unfalsifiable by design, so that you're able to create a fortress in your mind where you can tell yourself you're right no matter what happens.

Let's consider the following:

1. There's a large population of Palestinians living in Israel proper, about two million of them, or a fifth of the population. They have Israeli citizenship, full legal rights, they run for office, some of them are in government. There are cities in Israel, like Nazareth, where Arab Muslims are the majority. Does that sound consistent with a genocidal society? In Nazi Germany, were there Jews living peacefully in Berlin? Were there whole cities where Jews were the majority that were undisturbed? This clearly suggests the conflict is about something other than whether people are Palestinian or not.
* As we've known for decades, the IDF makes a significant effort to minimize civilian casualties while fighting extremist groups by warning civilians of any impending violence. They broadcast it, they call and text people, they use social media, they drop leaflets, they even monitor the area to assess whether people are actually receiving their warnings. The more you look into how the IDF operates, and has operated for some time, the more this interpretation that they're a secretly genocidal army trying to get away with genocide simply doesn't make any sense.
* If Israel is trying to eliminate the Palestinian population, then why did they create a political arrangement in which the Palestinian population has been increasing over time rather than decreasing, and the general quality of life for Palestinians in their own territory has been improving? If Hamas didn't attack them on 2023-Oct-7, they could've instead focused on continuing to improve their own lives and increasing their numbers. Israel wasn't trying to keep them down in that way.
* Why has Israel been so compromising? They withdrew from territory they once controlled, they negotiate and sign treaties, they helped facilitate the creation of the Palestinian governments. For most of its history, Israel has been the side that's willing to accept a partition plan and simply leave each other alone.
* Israel has relatively strong free speech laws. A significant amount of criticism of the Israeli state comes from Israel itself. There are humanitarian organizations like B'Tselem, Gisha, and Yesh Din. There's also left-leaning media like Haaretz that tends to be critical of the government. Does a country that's trying to commit genocide allow everybody to constantly monitor, criticize, and talk about everything they do?
* Israel is generally a very transparent society. A great deal of what we know about Israel's past wrongdoings is only available to us because the government chooses to declassify their archives. They release most information after a standard 30 years. That's why in the 1980s, historians like Ilan Pappé and Benny Morris were able to challenge Israeli history as it was then understood by scouring through the recently-declassified archives of events in the 1940s. Is this how a government that's engaging in an ideologically-driven, generations-long plot to commit genocide acts?

The conspiracy theorists' explanation for everything is simple, and can be applied before even hearing my arguments: "They're only doing that to make it *look* like they're not genocidal!"

On the other hand, there's a lot of potential things that could be evidence of genocidal intent *if they were to happen*, which is how we make this kind of inference in other cases. An ongoing conflict we could look to for comparison is the latest phase of the Russia--Ukraine war, in which it's been credibly asserted at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that Russia is engaging in genocidal actions against the Ukrainian people, because, in addition to their more direct combat-related war crimes, Russian leaders have denied Ukrainians even exist as a distinct people or nation; they've banned the Ukrainian language in the areas they control; and [they've kidnapped thousands of Ukrainian children, forcibly moved them to Russia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64985009), adopted them into Russian families, given them Russian citizenship, and have tried to make it difficult for them to ever reunite with any of their remaining family. This is forced assimilation, a direct assault on the Ukrainian identity. Has Israel ever done anything like that?

### Things to look out for

To help you get a sense of what I'd be looking for, here's a list of things that I'd expect if Israel were run by people who wanted to commit genocide against Palestinians, and which they so far haven't done (but if this changes and they do any of these things, then it of course warrants condemnation, and could make the genocide case stronger---not the "decades-long plot" case, but more "Israel has so much been pushed to the brink that it's now resorting to actions we consider genocidal"):

-- persecute, deport, or in any way diminish the legal equality of Israeli Arabs Muslims;
-- ban or in any way restrict Arabic being spoken or taught;
-- ban or in any way restrict the practice or teaching of Islam;
-- censor expressions of Palestinian identity, unity, or solidarity;
-- restrict the ability of Palestinians to organize or advocate for theirselves;
-- restrict the freedom of press, the ability of people to criticize Israeli state policy;
-- separate Arab children from their families, or otherwise try to break up existing family structures;
-- target places of religious community or worship (mosques, pilgrimage sites);
-- target historical religious sites (shrines, tombs of Islamic prophets, noteworthy events);
-- target unifying religious leaders (excluding those who support terrorism or other crimes);
-- target cemeteries, libraries, archives, or anything else that serves as a way for the group to connect with their past;
-- target iconic landmarks associated with Arabs or Muslims but unimportant to Jews, like the dome of the rock;
-- utilize militias or paramilitary groups to pursue their objectives in a way that's intended to insulate the Israeli state from accountability;
-- take any action to sterilize or otherwise restrict Arabs or Muslims from having children;
-- have a policy of imprisoning Arabs or Muslims in inhumane conditions;
-- enact a policy of summarily executing enemy Arabs or Muslims;
-- enact a policy of executing or imprisoning people for no reason beyond their being Arab or Muslim;
-- enact a policy of executing POWs, or indefinitely imprisoning POWs in inhumane conditions;
-- destroy vital infrastructure used by the general population as a means of harming terrorist groups;
-- deny the general population access to vital resources as a means of harming terrorist groups.

A number of these things could serve as evidence in favour of supposing Israeli leaders are acting with genocidal intent rather than simply engaging in a conflict against a military threat. If on the other hand a country is doing none of these things, then it doesn't resemble a genocide at all. It just looks like a military conflict. And for now, that's still how it appears to me.

The main reason some people say Israel is being genocidal *in the recent war* is the number of civilian deaths, which they believe is too high. It can be tricky to say how high is "too high", considering we know all wars result in some civilian deaths, and we can point to a number of ways in which Israel has *tried* to reduce that figure, as they've done in so many conflicts before.

This was also always going to be a high-casualty war, because that was Hamas's goal. They've set the stage for it to be. This is the game they've been playing for a while now: making it very difficult to fight them by putting their own people in harm's way. This is why Hamas "using human shields" has been a talking point for years now---and dragging Israel into fighting in a naturally high-casualty environment like Gaza is just the latest form of that.

Typically, a military builds its operations far away from where normal people live so that if an enemy attacks your country, your civilians aren't in the blast zone. And typically a military visibly distinguishes itself with uniforms, flags, insignias, and the like, so that an enemy can tell the difference between soldiers and civilians. That distinction, between military and civilian, is important to maintain, and respecting it is called the *principle of distinction* in the laws of armed conflict, or international humanitarian law. These are examples of things you do because you want to reduce civilian casualties---and of things that Hamas doesn't do, because they don't want to reduce civilian casualties.

Hamas builds its military bases under hospitals, under schools, in densely-populated urban or residential areas. They build tunnels under buildings that aren't clearly marked as being for any sort of military purpose. It's called 'tunnel warfare', and we're not sure exactly how large the tunnel network is they've built by this point, but it's under Gaza, they've probably got into Egypt and Israel, they use it to smuggle and hide weapons and other resources, and to move militants around within the region. It makes the place impossible to conduct normal warfare in. It's like a house ate out by termites.

Hamas militants also operate without distinction, meaning they effectively disguise theirselves among the civilian population. This contributes to civilian deaths indirectly because it makes it more difficult for Israeli soldiers to know who they can trust and who they're allowed to shoot at. It makes the whole situation messier, more chaotic, higher stress, more likely for mistakes to happen, more likely for civilians or militants or IDF soldiers to end up dying. They've also disguised theirselves as medical workers, aid workers, and journalists, which effectively reduces the amount of protection for people actually in those positions, because now IDF troops can't trust that somebody who looks like a doctor isn't actually a Hamas militant waiting for them to turn their back. They also infiltrate humanitarian organizations like UNRWA. This is not something militants should ever engage in.

The Israeli soldiers who are in this conflict have been going through hell. They're in hostile, foreign territory where seemingly everything wants to kill them, they have to be suspicious of everybody, there's reports about civilian buildings in Gaza being boobytrapped, so they can't even walk around feeling safe. They've really marched into the spider's web on this one. And the reason they're doing it is presumably decided that taking out Hamas has become so worth it to them that they're willing to pay a very high cost to do so.

And along the way, you can expect mistakes, you can expect to see incidents where there's a lapse of judgment, a lapse of discipline, in some cases Israelis might even take out their anger about the situation onto people in Gaza who don't deserve it. These are things I'd predict before they even happen, just based on what I know about past conflicts. The only thing I could really do about it is hope that Israel does all it can to reduce events like that and punish the people who step too much out of line when it happens.

## Indiscriminate bombing

To kill 'indiscriminately' means to not care who you're hurting, to make no distinction between people. It's the language we use when a crazed mass shooter fires a gun into a crowd at a mall or school or something. He doesn't care whom the bullets hit. He just wants to kill someone. *Anyone*.

To say a military is killing indiscriminately means they're not making a distinction between an enemy militant, who is a legitimate target, and some random civilian who isn't. In other words, they're not observing the **principle of distinction** in international humanitarian law. The only *discrimination* they're doing is, presumably: "Is that guy one of us? If not, then okay, kill him." It's what happens during genocides, purges, or massacres.

Is that what Israel is doing? If they were, it'd be a big deal. But I've come to believe that a lot of people throw this word around without realizing the gravity of it as an accusation. It might've been popularized by Joe Biden, who [said in December 2023](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67699255) that Israel was losing people's support because of the "indiscriminate bombing that takes place". That's one of the earliest popular instances of it after the war began that I could find when looking back. If Biden really thought Israel was bombing indiscriminately, then he should've been condemning Israel way harder than he was. But he probably just wasn't using the term properly.

In short, I don't believe there's evidence sufficient to say Israel is indiscriminately bombing anything.

## Dumb bombs

The idea that Israel is just randomly throwing bombs into Gaza with no regard for where they land may have come from the notion that Israel is using "dumb bombs", and misunderstandings about the implications of that term.

In the 1950s, the US began putting onboard computers or sensor systems onto some of its bombs, enabling them to steer theirselves while in flight. That's very useful if you're trying to shoot down a moving target like a plane, or ensure your missiles remain accurate from very long distances or through turbulent weather conditions. It was expensive and used sparingly but with increasing frequency throughout the latter half of the century, and only became standard by the 2000s. This sort of technology was dubbed 'smart bombs', and as such literally all munitions used prior became 'dumb' by comparison. Every bomb launched during WWII was a dumb bomb. And when you fire a rifle, that's a dumb munition.

So, a question: do we think all bombing prior to the last few decades was "indiscriminate"? I think the answer is obviously no.

The claim at this point *could* morph into saying that using dumb bombs shows how little regard Israel has for civilian casualties, because they could have fewer if they used smart bombs.

Maybe? But the difference between smart and dumb bombs isn't that significant in many circumstances. When a military plane shoots a missile at a building, it's generally just going to go exactly where they pointed it. If you're alleging they're being more destructive than necessary, maybe pointing to the weight and blast radius would help that case, but it seems like the destructive nature of their operation is understood openly. They're using huge bombs because they're trying to destroy the Hamas tunnel network, not just bomb a building to kill a soldier standing on the ground floor.

## The 2024 pager attack

In September 2024, thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon simultaneously. The next day, walkie-talkies. They were devices that had been sold to members of Hezbollah, a powerful paramilitary group that's taken over much of southern Lebanon. The Mossad infiltrated their supply lines to distribute these boobytrapped devices to their members after the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, instructed them to all start using pagers to communicate, as he believed Israel had infiltrated their cell networks.

I've been asked a number of times what I thought about this attack. I had initial reservations where I wasn't sure what to think, due to the novelty of it, but after digesting the situation for a bit, I'm not sure why it isn't preferable to any other way that Israel could've attacked Hezbollah members. This is very far from indiscriminate bombing. It's like they figured out a way to precision-strike only the group's members, even while they're dispersed throughout the country.

There were *some* civilian casualties, but that's not really an argument. Imagine if all the top Nazis were having a meeting at Hitler's estate and we had the opportunity to bomb the place, but there might be a few civilian servants in there who end up being casualties. Sometimes you accept that as the unfortunate cost of taking out your targets.

I saw many people online calling it a terrorist attack. It may have *literally* inspired terror, if all you think 'terrorism' means is anything that scares people. I saw somebody say that because Israel bombed militants, now everybody in the Middle East has to be scared that any device might blow up at any time if the IDF wants them dead. That's true in the dumbest sense possible. If a military plane attacks a legitimate military target, then I could say that makes me scared because it shows they could fly into my residential area to bomb my house. It could happen, right? So all violence is terrorism?

I think all that really happened there was people who were already staunchly anti-Israel saw the attack in the news and grasped at straws figuring out a way to spin it against them.

# Closing thoughts

This began as a place to host a few of my own thoughts (the "What should we do now?" section) and grew out from there as I added counter-arguments to things I was seeing online, then added some sections at the beginning to help frame or support the perspective I had.

It's not as comprehensive an overview of the conflict as its length could make it appear. It's mostly my own reasoning applied to what is ultimately a simple retelling of history. I'm not a scholar of the region with an impeccable grasp of all the material. I just read about it for a while, and this is me sharing my thoughts about it. I'm sure there's more one could say about it that I don't get into here because it doesn't relate directly to the questions or arguments that I wanted to talk about.

Part of what's interesting about Israel--Palestine is how two reasonable people can see the issue in very different ways, and come to opposite conclusions depending on what intuition they start with and which facts they focus on. It's also possible for somebody to present the history of the conflict in a very pro-Israel way *or* in a very pro-Palestine way, and neither version would be factually *wrong*; they would just be cherrypicking which parts of the story they tell you differently.

I haven't tried to focus on or present either the Israeli or Arab side more favourably than the other. Nor am I attached to the positions I hold about the conflict, as it's not anything fundamental or core to my thought. It's just some conflict---happening far away, and with no effect on me personally---that I was given to analyze, and so I did. So if you disagree with anything on this page, or you think you have anything novel to add, feel free to talk with me about it.
