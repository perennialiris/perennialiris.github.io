# Fetishism & politics

.2024-11-14

A strange reality I've made peace with is that people's political views on certain topics can be affected by their sexual attraction. The most obvious example would be that if a person is gay or bisexual, they're less likely to support legal repression of homosexuality---but there are also less direct forms of influence. I assume men finding trans women attractive pushes them to be more accepting of trans people interpersonally and more supportive of trans rights politically. There's probably a good number of them who didn't have much of an opinion on the topic, saw a trans woman they found attractive, and thought oh, wait a minute, she's trans? Heyyy, maybe this transgender thing isn't so bad after all.

Immigration and racism are also implicated. There's definitely people who are less opposed to increasing immigration because they're attracted to common immigrant groups. Try talking to a southern guy who's generally right-wing but has a thing for Latinas. It's like oh, you're not as anti-immigrant as all your friends Wow, you don't say.

**How should we feel about this?** I don't know. Is it love triumphing over hate? Maybe. Or lust triumphing over prejudice, or something.

It can also backfire, though. There are men who get turned on by a trans woman and freak out, thinking oh god, am I gay now? They come out the other side even more hateful than before, because now they have something to prove. That's probably why some of them fixate so hard on arguing that trans women are *always* ugly and *never* pass, *ever*. Who are they trying to convince, us or theirselves?

The original meaning of 'homophobia' was describing not a hatred for gay people, but straight men's fear of being perceived as gay by their peers. The worse being gay is, the worse the consequences of being *seen* as gay will be. In some cases, they may end up being scared they really *do*, deep down, have some gay thoughts at times---after all, many men do. The theory was that any hint of sexual tension with other men, or any display of sexuality between men, would trigger an internal panic (*"oh god, no, I'm not gay, I'M NOT GAY!"*). This gets channelled into hatred, which is partially genuine, but doubles as a show, a performance, a way of trying to convince their peers they aren't one of the gays (*"I can't be gay---I hate those people!"*).

Now the same phenomenon happens with trans women. I've talked with transphobic men who describe how *horrifying* it would be if they ever got tricked into doing something sexual with trans women. And okay, fine, that's understandable to some extent. Nobody wants to be deceived, especially about sex. But their reaction is over the top compared with most other things, or how anybody else would react in similar scenarios. If I have sex with somebody and the next day I realize they have political opinions I find distasteful, I might regret it, but was I raped? And would I get so angry that I end up murdering them in a blind rage and [trying to defend myself in court by saying their gayness caused me to become temporarily insane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense), thus absolving me of guilt?

They also seem to find a trans woman passing at all to be an act of problematic deception. The question they're asked isn't "what if a person lies to your face and promises she's not trans and was born female?", it's more like "imagine you have a one-night stand with some girl at a bar and you don't realize she's trans til afterwards", and they still react the way a normal person might if we asked how they'd feel about getting violently raped or something.

### Is being attracted to trans people a fetish? And is fetishizing people bad?

I'm grouping these questions together because they seem interconnected. First, in case you don't know anything: the term 'fetish' was used a long time ago to describe an item that people thought had some kind of mystical power, like a special amulet inhabited by spirits. Taken from this, the term 'sexual fetish' was coined for when somebody derived a special sort of sexual gratification from an item that isn't normally sexual, like rubber boots. They're reacting *as though* there's something special about the item, even though to us it's just a normal thing. It's like it has some kind of special power over just them.

There's been other terms along the way, like 'partialism' (an interest in a particular body part, e.g. if you were really into armpits for some reason, we might call that an armpit partialism), and 'paraphilia' (intended to be a clinical catch-all for any unusual behaviour). 'Fetish' has outlived all these other terms, and gradually broadened to the point where it is now, where it's just used as a catch-all for any unusual attraction or affinity for something---like how paraphilia was intended to be. And now nobody ever says paraphilia, so forget that word. It lost the word war.

So is it bad---and by *bad*, we mean harmful or immoral---if you feel a particular sexual attraction or affinity for something? The answer is obviously no, at least these days. Some people may find a specific fetish icky, but society doesn't consider *having a fetish* to be you doing something wrong. In fact, it's not even an action with moral valence, because it's not a choice. It's just something you become aware of at some point---like being gay.

That's if your fetish is something like armpits, or getting tied up, or people smoking cigarettes. There's glaring exception to our tolerance, which is if what you're fetishizing is transgender people, or---similarly---a certain racial group. Those both raise some eyebrows. Some people are okay with it, but many other people feel really weird about it, and will even condemn you for expressing or acting on it. It may seem, at a glance, like the rule is that you can be attracted to certain actions, or scenarios, or things, including specific body parts---but not to whole identities of people. That's like, objectification, or something. But is that a consistent explanation?

There's plenty of people who have a particular attraction to redheads. The hair colour, the pale skin, the freckles. It's an appealing look. Is that bad? It doesn't seem like anybody considers it to be. Not only is it *not* considered bad, but most people don't even talk about it as a fetish at all. It's just a preference, or a particular fondness, or an affinity for. Or *a thing*. It might not even get a proper label: they just *have a thing for* redheads.

We can repeat this about numerous other outer qualities: loving tall women, loving men with beards, loving women with small breasts, and so on. Are any of those things fetishes? I asked around, and the answer seems to be no, none of those things are fetishes. They're just preferences. They're just things you like. Is it because they're too normal? Is that why they're not fetishes? They aren't weird enough? I think so. Fetishes are supposed to be weird things. Those things aren't weird enough, so they're not fetishes. It's a blurry distinction, but that's how it works.

And that's where I take issue with all this fetish talk. Why is an attraction to blonde women normal, but an attraction to Asian women a fetish, if the thing that makes a thing a fetish or not is its weirdness? Is it weird to be attracted to an Asian person? They're both just describing a certain look, a bundle of aesthetic qualities. I don't think an attraction to black women seems that different from an attraction to ginger women. I wouldn't have thought either attraction is a fetish, but judging by how people treat them, it seems like only one is.

I think it's because of our history of racism. In the past, attraction to white people was the default, while attraction to black people, as a white person, was discouraged, looked down upon, taboo. So admiring white women with an uncommon hair colour? That's far more normalized in our society. It's like, yeah, *of course* blonde women are pretty. We don't need a special term or label for that. But finding black women attractive? Ew! That must be a fetish.

Interracial attraction used to be so taboo that people compared it with having a disease that warps your judgment and corrupts your sensibilities (attraction to black people was called 'jungle fever' and attraction to Asian people was called 'yellow fever', both plays on existing diseases of the day). If it's bad and taboo, then it's weird, which makes it a fetish. But is that still how anybody should be viewing it?

In a way, even relatively forward-thinking people today who label interracial attraction a fetish are engaging in a similar behaviour: discouraging you from being honest about your feelings, and implicitly belittling the object of your attraction for being a difference race from you. Seriously, think about what's being said: attracted to people of your race? Normal. Attracted to people of a different race? That's a fetish. Is this progressive of us?

It's all the implicit notion that you're not *supposed to be* attracted to black people, so if you *are*, then we need some kind of explanation for why, and the one society settled on was belittling the attraction as 'just a fetish', a corruption, a perversion of 'normal' sexuality. This is what I'm objecting to. And guess what? Attraction to trans people is considered a fetish for about the same reason.

### The experience of being fetishized

The people who were victims of racism may feel uneasy about being fetishized by members of the same group that normally mistreats them. This is because there's a real history of fetishization *not* counteracting prejudice and abuse, but merely accompanying it. Through experience, people may learn that members of the oppressor-class, who normally want nothing to do with you, suddenly swinging hard in the opposite direction and trying to sleep with you, can be, let's say, tricky. As it turns out, sexually pleasuring somebody doesn't guarantee they're going to be your ally outside the bedroom (in case the history of misogyny didn't make that clear enough already).

Let's imagine a man is really attracted to Asian women. It's possible he goes after any random Asian woman he sees, and doesn't really bother trying to get to know them as people, because who cares? Their only purpose for him is to satisfy his fetish. If one breaks up with him, he could just ask out the next one he comes across. In this way, he treats them like replaceable commodities. For the women he's pursuing, this might not be apparent at first. When they realize it, that realization can be a painful one.

But this description could be repeated without any reference to race. We're just describing a man who's only interested in women for sex. Why does it matter if he *also* has a thing for a certain racial group? This would be like if we had a special name for the distinct act of murdering somebody with a different hair colour from yours. Are we focusing on the wrong aspects of the scenario?

For white women, a man's intentions is an open question. If a man is sexually attracted to you, then he could *also* be interested in you as a person and want to form a serious relationship. But if you're a racial minority in a racist society where interracial relationships are taboo, that's not as realistic an option. If a white man is sexually attracted to you, it's probably just about the sex, because the rest ain't happenin'. In minority communities, young girls are *warned* about men from the majority, because if you're using to the majority mistreating you, then you could mistake one of them *not* mistreating you as indication he's different---but really, he's probably not. He's just masking his racism because he wants to sleep with you; then he'll go back to being like everybody else.

**This experience gives rise to a second meaning of fetishize or fetishization.**

When some people talk about fetishization, what they mean is not merely having a particular attraction or affinity for something, but the act of treating somebody shallowly, only seeing them as a vehicle for satisfying your attraction. A person might even say, "it's okay to be attracted to black women, but you shouldn't fetishize them"---and what they mean by that is, roughly, "you shouldn't look past the individual and only praise her for *being a black woman*, because that makes it seem like your appreciation for her is shallow and you're more interested in her group or category than in her as a person".

The issue is that as much as I'm able to understand where the apprehension about 'being fetishized' *comes from*, there's nothing inseparable about these two meanings, and there's a constant mix-up because some people use the word for the first meaning (having a particular attraction to) and others for the second (shallowly using somebody to satisfy that attraction). It's only the latter that's really a problem. In a society that's overwhelmingly prejudiced against a certain group, you might reason that where there's the first, there will also be the second (i.e. a person who fetishizes the minority will probably just shallowly use them to satisfy their attraction).

But that's not the case anymore, and it makes no sense to act as though it is. If we believe that none of the people involved are actually racist and there *is* a genuine connection to the individual as in other relationships, then I'm unable to find what in that is harmful. Actually, I'll go a step further: even if the person *is* racist to some extent---like, they have some ingrained racism in the back of their mind from their upbringing, or they feel some kind of taboo about being with a person of another race---that doesn't necessarily make it harmful either. It can be self-aware and productive, as in helping to develop better attitudes by engaging with it through sexual play. It all just depends on how both participants approach it.

## Transgender fetishism

There are people who fetishize trans women. Some are guilty about it, some aren't. Should I treat them as a problem or threat to me? Should I treat them with distrust, act like they're doing something wrong or messed up?

That's what many trans people do. The men who express an interest in us are labelled *trans chasers*, or just *chasers* for short, and they're villains of the trans community.

From the outside looking in, that's a confusing affair. Trans people spend all this time wanting to be accepted, seeking approval and validation---but a man comes around and says he wants us, and we call him a fetishist and treat him like he's gross? What's our *problem*? Do we want normal men to be attracted to us, or don't we?

It's a similar caution as what racial minorities experience. There's a worry that ultimately this person will be just as transphobic as other people in society. They're just hiding it for a minute to lure us in, because they fetishize us. I've even heard some people *define* a 'trans chaser' as a transphobic person who fetishizes trans people, which makes sense from their point of view.

It's probably all wrapped up in the history of trans representation, and the way normal people are likely to (still) conceive of trans women as a result. For decades, people didn't know the term 'transgender' or 'transsexual'. They didn't come into the mainstream until the 2010s. Instead, they were crossdressers and transvestites (a fancy way for crossdresser), and crossdressing was occasionally depicted in movies like *Psycho* (1960) and *Silence of the Lambs* (1991), which associated it with crazy people. Then eventually the adult film industry rolled in, and dudes on pornography websites started getting offered videos featuring 'trannies', 'shemales', and 'ladyboys'. In 2015, there were some big leaps in trans representation (Caitlyn Jenner, Jazz Jennings). There was also a movie called *Tangerine* (2015), which was about two transexual prostitutes. It's difficult to get away from the 'slutty pornographic sex worker' association. And to be fair, trans people often play into it.

This unique angle of our very existence being popularized by pornography contributes to 'being perceived as an interchangeable commodity' being an even more literal reality for trans people than it is for other groups. We're like mythical creatures, treated like fantasy objects come to life, like if you wanted to fuck a centaur or something. *'They're like women---but with a twist.'*

An observation that reinforces this dynamic is how many people who would self-describe as having a trans fetish (or at least being 'into' us) explicitly have a preference for pre-op trans women, or even say they'd *only* be interested in a pre-op trans woman. *No dick? No thanks.* Think about why this may be.

I'm sure there's innocent (i.e. not malicious---possibly ignorant, though) reasons a person might have that preference---or, less a preference for dick and more of an icky feeling associated with vaginas created through vaginoplasty. But it also comes off very much like "if you don't have a dick, then what's the point? I could just go get a cis woman instead." And I do think that's their mindset. For them, the special little surprise in our pants is the only thing that makes us special or interesting. Without it, we're a strict downgrade. That's the message people who say things like this are effectively delivering.

It's also worth noting guys like that will even try to talk trans women out of getting bottom surgery, and react negatively to hearing about trans women getting it. Once upon a time, one of them said "a trans girl without her penis is like an angel without its wings" and trans people have memed about it ever since. Well, some of us have.

Trans women are an emotionally vulnerable demographic. We're often depressed or anxiety-ridden, we have issues with our families, we're insecure about how we look. A guy swooping in and finding us attractive can be amazing---but at the same time, that can open the door for manipulation and abuse, because you'll give somebody a lot of leeway when you're desperate. And some guys act like they're doing us a favour by thinking we're hot, like we owe them one, and they revel in what that position allows them to *get away with*. So some level of caution is warranted.

The worst experience I've personally had was chatting with a guy who seemed interested in me, until he randomly opened up and explained the reason he's attracted to trans women is because he's normally a gay top and viewed us like bottoms who were engaging in the highest act of submission possibly by taking estrogen for him. So in other words, he just viewed me as a dude who transitioned into a girl to please him, as part of his ultimate domination fantasy. It made me feel terrible hearing this is how he viewed me. Why did he even tell me this? (We never met.)

### *Fine, then what am I supposed to do?*

I don't want to make this sound complicated, because I don't think it is. For the most part just don't act in the ways I've described above. I don't think it's a high bar, beyond that.

I don't think most trans women desire any kind of special praise or emphasis on the fact they're trans. There's probably a right way to do it if you're careful, and she already knows and trusts you and your intentions; but calling it out has a high risk of making us nervous, because it sounds like you're viewing us through a fundamentally different lens from the one you'd see cis women through, which isn't what we want. Not generally, at least.

Trans women have a sort of inferiority complex, where we compare ourselves disfavourably with cis women, who represent the standard we're trying to live up to. So if your goal is to avoid making us feel bad, you should probably avoid:

1. implying you could go get a cis woman instead and that'd be an upgrade for you,
* implying you resorted to being with trans women because getting a cis woman was too difficult,
* that you settled for us because we were easier,
* implying that you oh so charitably decided to overlook us being trans and offer yourself despite that glaring downside on our part.

If you don't say mean or devaluing things that make us sad, then I don't really see the downside of anybody having a 'fetish' for us, in the first sense (having an affinity for something).

It's just like, oh, is there something about us being trans that makes us more attractive to you, for some reason? That's cool.

### Is trans fetishism moving society in a more accepting direction?

That's what I was thinking about when I began this post. In some cases it pushes people away, if they're already predisposed to homophobia; but my intuition is that far more pressure ends up being applied in a pro-acceptance direction than the reverse.

The growing popularity of transgender women in pornography, which is now being offered as a category to men who visit general pornography websites (instead of being locked away in some niche website, separate from everything else) and enjoyed by way more men than are likely to admit it (it's quickly become one of the most profitable categories for adult film companies to produce) is probably making people more open-minded, challenging their ideas about gender and sexuality, and overall making society less hateful in general.

It feels weird to acknowledge that, though. And it'd be neat if we lived in a world where your rights aren't in any way affected by whether or not you get people's dicks hard. But it is what it is.
