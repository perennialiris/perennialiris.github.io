# The Nazi salute

Did Elon Musk do a Nazi salute, or did it just look like one? It's an insulting stupid question, but one that Mr. Musk himself is betting on people asking. No, I'd say it was obviously intended to be a Nazi salute. The question is, why? Some people are saying that Elon just outed himself *as a Nazi* on the world stage---but wasn't the controversy like *a month ago* that he was fighting *against* all the anti-Indian racist hard-liners over that immigration program thing?

And to be sure, I don't understand how anyone can pretend this was anything other than what it was. Here, I'm even going to include a video of it:

I don't think Elon Musk is a Nazi in the normal sense, but he's obviously gone down numerous far-right online rabbit-holes and liked a lot of what he found. He's probably some kind of social Darwinist at least, or believes in some kind of authoritarianism justified by meritocratic rhetoric. People who are highly competent in some areas but not well-rounded thinkers often love the sound of competent people *like them* (or so they think) taking over society and just doing, well, whatever they want---and not having to listen to anyone. There's no joke when Elon posts things about how [maybe democracy should be limited to high-testosterone males](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-shares-controversial-theory-democracy-1947873), or whatever the latest shitpost is. He spends a disgusting amount of time in a conspiracy-brained horseshit echo chamber of his own making on Twitter. He went from an avid Twitter user to an X power-user. He posts basically every waking hour, and constantly endorsing extremist views from random accounts while sprinkling in lies of his own.

But I don't think dictator Elon Musk would try to make America whites-only, even if he could. It's more complicated than racism, even though they feel okay exploiting racism among their supporters. Then again, does it matter whether Mosley was really anti-semitic or if he just turned that way because he realized his followers were? Are the pogroms less violent if the people at the top are also liars?

**Here's my interpretation:** Elon Musk did a Nazi salute as an exercise of power. It's a way of saying "Look at me---I can do a Nazi salute while on stage with the US president, all eyes on me. And there's nothing you can do about it."

Trump was engaging in a similar thing when he said he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose any supporters. In that case, he was also affirming that his supporters are loyal to him, even if he does terrible things, which is a goddamn confession of an acknowledgement, but in a strange way is also 'rewarding' the people for that loyalty. But Trump and Elon are both in the business of bragging about how much they can get away with. It's supposed to frustrate and demoralize you. It's supposed to make you feel like they've won. And it probably fascinates them. They feel like they're on top of the world. Like they can do anything. And to a large degree they're right, because they've ended up in situations where nobody can hold them accountable, and they're surrounded by enablers and grifters and cocksuckers. And the crowd of idiots outside who supported them last week will keep supporting them next week, since nothing they do matters anymore.

This feels related to the way in which new-age dictators lie. They don't need to actually deceive you anymore. It's not about being tricky and sophisticated. They can just lie to your face in a way you're obviously not going to believe, and then smile because they know there's nothing you can do. They know you know they're lying, and to them that's funny. You can imagine them saying "yeah, I'm lying. What are you gonna do about it?" And then, because they lie every day and control a bunch of newspapers and TV stations and internet bloggers who all repeat their lies every day, people who aren't as plugged in to the system, like your elderly relatives, will probably end up believing them, and then going out and voting for them. Then when you, the person who sees through their bullshit, confronts them, all they have to do is smile.

As various reporters noticed, [far-right groups and media figures are obviously happy](https://apnews.com/article/musk-gesture-salute-antisemitism-0070dae53c7a73397b104ae645877535). And make no mistake, Elon Musk knew they would be. Do you know what I'd do if I accidentally did a gesture that anybody thought was a Nazi salute? I'd say it wasn't. I'd take the opportunity to denounce Nazism and racism and talk about how much I detest anybody who would think I'm on their side if they thought they saw me doing a Nazi salute. Elon Musk was online hours later, and constantly since then, but he's not going to do anything like that, because that would go against the point of doing the salute in the first place.

I'm not a great oracle of predictions, but I worry more people will end up doing Nazi salutes at Trump events in the future, because Elon Musk has legitimized it as an action. What happens if Trump does it? I don't think he would. It's not his style. But anything could happen. The question is, could crowds of Americans just randomly decide they've reclaimed the Nazi salute and that it's no longer a bad thing? Perhaps if their dear leader tells them to believe as much.

And now the internet is awash in even more lies in response to this whole debacle: people across the internet are *pretending* that all politicians Nazi salute sometimes, but that we only care when Elon does it. They're spamming pictures of any random time a Democratic Party politician stretched their hand out, and *pretending* that's the same. They know it's not. It's another "yeah, we're lying, what are you gonna do about it?" moment. It's all a game to them.

And you have those pseudo-centrists, who just want to sound like they're the reasonable middle ground of every news story, saying "come on, let's be reasonable and not jump to conclusions", as though interpreting the Nazi salute as a Nazi salute is some kind of unreasonable extreme. I already saw people referring to the reaction as "the Nazi salute hoax", trying to rewrite history before the ink is even dry.

Meanwhile, Musk is in Germany, endorsing the further-right party he could find and telling them about how they're going to lose their identity because of immigration. And he's going to play stupid about why people are saying the things they're saying.
