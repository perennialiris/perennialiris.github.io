# **Dehumanization** |2024-12-15

To *dehumanize *somebody implies they're undeserving of the most basic rights or considerations we typically afford to all humanity. It reduces them instead to the level of passive objects or lower animals. It suggests their perspective and experiences don't matter. It discounts their feelings, their wants and needs. It encourages us to be callous, and discourages us from feeling sympathy.

It's more than a coincidence that dehumanization is historically connected with actual political violence and genocide. It's like somebody figured out an exploit in how our minds process other beings, if you remove from people that most essential identity of being *our fellow human*.

The process of dehumanization can take many forms and exists to many different degrees. Some noteworthy examples:

- In the Nazi regime, Jews and other minority groups were called [subhuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch), portrayed as [rodents or other vermin](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/sturm28.htm).
- In the Soviet Union, class traitors known as 'kulaks' were called [parasites, vampires, or leeches](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/sturm28.htm), among other things.
- The Indigenous peoples of North America were called [untamed creatures](https://web.archive.org/web/20071209193251/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm) and [merciless savages](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/americas-twofold-original-sin/606163/), not rising to the level of civilized Europeans.
- In the years leading up to the Rwandan genocide, the Tutsi people were [called snakes and cockroaches](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/rwanda-shows-how-hateful-speech-leads-violence/587041/), before militia groups ran through the territory, killing hundreds of thousands.

Dehumanizing language and imagery obscures the reality of what is being done. Suddenly we're not murdering our fellow man—only *exterminating the vermin*, *putting down an animal*, or *cleansing our country of filth*. This perverse abstraction is how people who want to employ violence may circumvent the natural resistance we all feel to inflicting suffering onto others—like how the Nazis started using gas chambers instead of shooting their victims, to lessen the psychological toll the latter had on their own soldiers.

Viktor Kravchenko, a Soviet army captain reflecting on the role he played in Stalin's purges, explained that "to spare yourself mental agony, you veil unpleasant truths from view by half-closing your eyes, and your mind." (Krevchenko later defected to the US.)

**Not all comparisons with non-human entities are dehumanizing.** To dehumanize somebody means more than simply comparing them with something non-human. We make comparisons with non-human things to evoke certain qualities—like calling somebody a pig to mean they're rude, or calling a lady a fox to imply she's attractive.

The question is whether the intention, or the result, is implying the target of comparison is less than human, undeserving of the basic rights and considerations afforded to humans, or a passive objective undeserving of consideration or sympathy. That's the case with some comparisons but not others, and the same comparison can be dehumanizing in one instance but not another.

For example, if somebody in America says you're a snake, the meaning is probably to suggest that you're a treacherous or dishonest person, and I wouldn't call that dehumanizing—but in the Cambodian genocide, when the government was encouraging people to slaughter their class enemies, and those enemies were called snakes, that probably was dehumanizing. So the critical detail isn't whether a non-human thing is evoked, but what effect it's being evoked *for*.

There are many phrases that can be dehumanizing, or can accidentally have a dehumanizing effect on the listener, even if not used with that intent. In the [Wikipedia entry on dehumanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization#Language), the term 'illegal alien' is mentioned as an example of language that can be dehumanizing—but that term is so normal that I wouldn't accuse somebody who says it of *trying *to dehumanize others.

However, I'm willing to reflect on how 'alien' how in modern times come to be associated primarily with non-human lifeforms from outer space, which are *sometimes *intelligent and human-like but often not, so even though I wouldn't restrict this term, perhaps there is a case to use better, more thoughtful language instead. And I encourage other people to engage in this kind of self-reflection.

The instances of dehumanization I most often encounter online are attacks against political identities, racial groups, poor people, and migrants. There's a pattern in right-wing spaces to carelessly dehumanize the far-left. There's even a popular quote I see circulate every so often by a Polish mercenary named Rafał Gan-Ganowicz who supposedly said he didn't know what it feels like to take a human life because he's only ever killed communists. I'm not sure whether it's a genuine quote or not, but you can appreciate the meaning other way: the lives of Russian soldiers he killed are unimportant or trivial because of their political affiliation. Or just because of their nationality, really.

Dehumanization isn't limited to extremists or online forums. It's something we see public figures engage in. In recent years it's been applied to refugees, depicting them as rats, ants, or various non-human primates. In Europe, this is applied especially to black people and Muslims. In the US, it's sometimes applied to Latin Americans, though less frequently.

**Some examples:**

- In 2018, then-president Trump said "[These aren't people, these are animals](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/us/politics/fact-check-trump-animals-immigration-ms13-sanctuary-cities.html)", referring to Mexicans in the United States.
- In 2023, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant said "[We are fighting against animals](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-defense-minister-human-animals-gaza-palestine_n_6524220ae4b09f4b8d412e0a)", referring to people in Gaza.
- [Zsolt Bayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsolt_Bayer), who wrote in 2015 [describing migrants as hordes of "wild animals"](https://www.magyarhirlap.hu/velemeny/Elkerulhetetlen)</a>.

In some cases you can understand a person's motivation (e.g. somebody experiences deep personal loss at the hands of another group) but still recognize that it's better if we avoid language and framing like this.

On a similar note, another group that's often targeted is criminals. When a person does a terrible crime, the reaction is often that we feel anger toward them, and some people will then resort to dehumanization. This is improper and should be avoided. The great test of the morality of a nation is how it treats people who are at its mercy, including people who do something horrible. Whether violent extremists, terrorists, serial killers, fascists, pedophiles, etc.---they're all still people, they have certain rights, and how we treat them matters.

I don't demand everybody be nice and polite at all times, but I do think we can try to foster a culture where we're more conscientious about how we communicate and treat one another. We should self-reflect on our language and what implications we may incidentally be carrying or contributing to. We can often do better than the bare minimum that platform rules require of us.
