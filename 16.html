# Milo Yiannopoulos's cancellation |2025-02-04

Why did Milo Yiannopoulos get career-nuked? I heard a few people talking about it recently, and all of them somehow remembered incorrectly in a way that was more charitable toward him than is necessary. They forgot how bad it was. They implied that maybe people were just being too touchy.

There was an interview where Milo said when he was younger he had relations with men who were significantly older than him. Would it be strange to get cancelled for talking about your own experiences? Maybe, maybe not, but that's not really the thing that did him in.

In 2016, Milo went on [podcast thing on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY) where he said that it's appropriate for 28-year-old men to have relationships with 13-year-olds, and that he would consider this perfectly consensual.

||indent
**other host:** *If someone I knew someone around my age that was like, I just had sex with a 13-year old, I would be creeped out.*
**Milo:** But what is your age?
**other host:** *I'm almost 35.*
**Milo:** Okay, well **I'm talking about 28 year-olds.** I'm guessing, because I've never told this publicly, that you won't hear that in this video, **but we're talking about 13--25, 13--28. These things do happen, perfectly consensually.**
**Milo:** Often, by the way, it's the women who suffer in these. What normally happens in schools, very often, is it's an older woman with a younger boy, and the boy is the predator in that situation, the boy is like, let's see if I can fuck the gym teacher, or let's see if I can fuck the hot maths teacher, and he does.
**Milo:** The women fall in love with these nubile young men, or these athletic young boys in their prime, and end up having their lives destroyed, they end up having to move schools, move the country, whatever.

Notice the change in focus. Milo changes it from relationships about older men and little girls, to being about older men and young gay guys, to being about young boys and older women---even flipping the script and asking us to pity the women who fuck 13-year-old boys.

But he still clearly maintains that it's acceptable, no matter the gender of either person. He doesn't even disavow the older-man--young-girl example, or say "this is only okay if it's an older woman". There's no reason he wouldn't think it applies equally well to young girls.

And my god, why is that even supposed to 'work' on anybody? Does he think the audience is going to think "yeah, a woman in her 30s having sex with a 'nubile' 13-year-old in his 'prime', that sounds fine with me"? Are his own sensibilities so different from normal people's that he thought this would be a reasonable stepping stone?

**Why did Milo say this?** Even if this was his internal belief, he had a burgeoning career as an instigator slash propagandist. Did he think he was untouchable? Did he not see the negative reaction coming? I think he was already *so* offensive to the left that he figured what they think doesn't matter, and the right was accepting him despite how offensive he was, so he lost track of the fact it was possible to piss them off too.

He was going to be a speaker at CPAC and had a book deal with a publisher called Simon & Schuster, but both cancelled it after these statements. Milo shortly after stepped down from his role at Brietbart, and many people haven't heard from him since.

>**Milo**: We get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff, and, to the point where we're, you know, heavily policing even relationships between consenting adults, you know, sort of, grad students and professors at universities, in a way that never happened before.
