# Israel--Palestine

||date
2025-07-27

Israel--Palestine feels like the most divisive, polarizing issue these days. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. Are you siding with the terrorists, fascists, theocrats, antisemites, the people who target civilians and use their own people as human shields? No, wait---are you siding with the apartheid state that's trying to genocide the Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor. It feels like no matter what you say, some portion of the population will end up hating you.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. It's strained some of mine. I'm willing to take that risk over certain issues, where if somebody disagrees with me I'd prefer they know. But as this topic was so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, let alone change their minds, and was not immediately relevant to my country's politics anyway (most voters didn't care much about conflicts on the other side of the world), for years my position was that it wasn't worth getting into, so I largely avoided the conversation. And this is what many people in society did as well, until the [October 7 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks) pulled the conflict back into the spotlight and made it fashionable to have a strong opinion about.

As debate about Israel--Palestine now seems unavoidable and is in the public interest (i.e. I'm now *expected*, in a way that I wasn't a few years ago, to have a clear position about it), I've here compiled my own thoughts about every aspect of the scenario I can think of. If you want to argue with me about it, you can direct me to what part of this page you disagree with.

## Terms clarification

To make this all more accessible, let's start with some maps and definitions of key terms.

||table
**Gaza**, or the **Gaza Strip** | the small territory in the western corner of Israel, a densely-populated area with a few major cities (the main one, in the north, is called Gaza city, and is *sometimes* also referred to simply as Gaza---pay attention for that); many of its residents are descendents of refugees displaced from Israel in the 1940s (many others went to Jordan)
**West Bank** | the larger Palestinian territory on the **east** side of Israel, so called because it's the west bank of the Jordan River, the natural feature that separates Israel from Jordan
**Palestine** | the combination of the West Bank and Gaza ("Palestine" historically referred to the whole area, including what is now Israel, so now it effectively means "the remaining parts that are not Israel")
the **Golan Heights**, or the **Golan** | the region between Israel and Syria, effectively controlled by Israel (Israel annexed it in 1981); this is considered an illegal occupation; international organizations consider it an Israeli-occupied part of Syria
**Hamas** (the Islamic Resistance Movement) | this can refer to the civil government of Gaza (since 2007), but also to its affiliated militant Islamist wing; the intended meaning varies by context, though the latter use (talking about the terrorist wing) is more common
**Hezbollah** (Party of Allah) | the militant Islamist group that operates in southern Lebanon, which has infiltrated the Lebanon government and exists as a parallel force within Lebanon
the **Houthis** | the militant Islamist group that controls western Yemen (they came to prominence in 2014, but gained more attention in 2023 after they started attacking ships passing through the Red Sea)
the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (the PLO), as represented by the **Palestine Authority** (or the **Palestine National Authority**) | a national coalition meant to represent the Palestinian population (founded 1964); the official representative of Palestine at the United Nations (since 1974);---it was initially labelled a terrorist group and its stated goal was the total destruction of Israel, but it became more moderate over time; the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords) (1993--1995) placed the Palestinian territories under control of the **Palestine Authority**, a governing body controlled by [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah), the largest party within the PLO coalition;---the Palestine Authority still controls the West Bank to this day, but notably they *lost* control of Gaza to Hamas in 2006
**IDF** | Israeli Defense Forces (the Israeli military)
**Mossad** | common name for the Israeli national intelligence agency; derived from the Hebrew for *institution*
**Zionism** | the movement started by Jews in late-19th century Europe to create a state in the Middle East where Jewish people could be the majority and ergo have political self-determination; the name originates from Mount Zion, a location in Jerusalem, which is considered the historical home of the Jewish people

## Why care about this topic?

It's common when talking about Israel--Palestine for people to accuse one another of having the worst of intentions. This makes dialogue very challenging. How can you find common ground with somebody who's just plain evil? I become disinterested when somebody accuses me of either only criticizing Israel because I hate Jews, or of only defending Israel because I hate Arabs or Muslims. At that point we're no longer really talking about Israel--Palestine, but having a meta-conversation about my motivation for talking about it. And if that's truly what somebody believes about me, then I don't know why they would want to talk to me anyway.

There *is* a realistic danger of people being guided through this topic by bad intentions or being influenced by prejudice. A person who's very pro-Israel could be motivated by racism and dehumanization of Arabs or Muslims. We've all seen people who think of Palestinians as uncivilized savages, or as people who are incapable of peace, incapable of living in modern society, who are naturally violent and intolerant and drawn to terrorism. They ultimately view the Palestinians as nothing more than a nuisance, and some of them wouldn't mind if Israel just decided to wipe them out all already. They act as though all Palestinians are guilty of the actions of terrorist groups, and they also weaponize the fact Palestinians have an Islamic culture that is repressive of homosexuality and of women's rights, as though being born into such a culture is a crime for which the Palestinians deserve some kind of cosmic punishment.

And then, when it comes to people who are very critical of Israel, the fear is they could be motivated by antisemitism, or a bias against Jewish people. I've encountered people who seem to fit this description. They fixate on Israeli wrongdoing, while ignoring all other wars, conflicts, and cruelty elsewhere in the world, even just elsewhere in the Middle East. They seem to care about international law, but really only care when Israel is violating it. They seem to care about genocidal and dehumanizing rhetoric, except when it's directed against Jews. They often fall into believing conspiracy theories about Jews pulling the strings in Western governments, manipulating our foreign policy, and controlling our media. They say, through the language of "anti-Zionism", that it's impossible for Jewish people to be the majority and have political self-determination without all turning into genocidal monsters for some reason. They offer endless compassion and understanding for Arabs who engage in terrorism, but none at all for innocent Jews born into Israel, surrounded by people who want them dead, growing up learning about how most of their people's history has been fleeing persecution, and wanting to be able to feel safe in their homeland.

I'm wary of either possibility, and I do what I can to combat racist or dehumanizing speech in our community. I will argue that most Palestinians are unworthy of scorn or hatred, that they're our fellow human beings and how we treat them matters---including those of them who are actually in terrorist groups, which is not the majority. As I've said before, the greatest test of your morality is how you treat somebody who's at your mercy. I likewise try to be wary about how Jewish people are treated and spoken of, which in my case---because I tend to interact with more left-wing people than right-wing these last few years---has so far been the greater of two struggles.

I've many times heard it asked why people in the West care so much Israel--Palestine either way. The implication can be that a person's focus on it, of all things, is evidence for their having bad motives. But we must admit there are plenty of legitimate reasons for a person in the West to be very attentive to the Israel--Palestine conflict, and even to give it far more attention than wars or conflicts elsewhere in the world. Consider the many points of entry at which a person could become acutely aware of it in the first place:

* We are all likely to become *aware* of Israel because our history classes invariably teach about World War II, the Holocaust, and the League of Nations. In this way, the founding of Israel feels related to our own history, and what happens there may feel like our fault or our responsibility, which can give somebody motivation to care how it turns out.
* We could hear about it each election cycle, when some of our politicians get on stage and clarify their support for Israel. It's something they get asked about in debates. I specifically recall that in past elections in my home country of Canada, the Conservative Party would include their support for Israel as a list item somewhere on their party platform on their website. I don't believe any other countries were explicitly mentioned like this. I understand why somebody thought to include it on that page, but I can also understand a person unfamiliar with the conflict seeing that and thinking, hey, what gives? Is that something I should be worried about? Why is this country so important that politicians feel the need to talk about it, of all things? In this way, the emphasis, the idea that it should stand out among all other conflicts in the world, is really given to us by society.
I can also imagine that if people in my government were all expected to have a position on what's happening in Andorra, then I would instantly want to know more about what's happening there than I do now, which is practically nothing (the fact I can point to it on a map likely places me as above-average for Andorra-related knowledge). Then, if I found out the Andorran government were doing things I find gravely immoral, I might be upset if so many people in our government wanted to keep sending them aid.
* The Israel--Palestine conflict has become noteworthy because of its longevity. It's been going on for so long, and is so commonly seen as intractable, that for much of my life "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline, a simile for an unrealistic goal that you don't know how to achieve. This itself can make people curious: what could be so difficult about it? Why *hasn't* the world been able to get these two groups to stop fighting and killing each other after so long? There must be something about it, right?
* There's been more activism on behalf of the Palestinian cause than for either side of many other issues. We could ask why that is---but we could also step back and realize it's not any one person's fault this is the case. We can't blame somebody for being more aware of Israel--Palestine than they are of the Boko Haram insurgence in Nigeria when they grew up in an environment where their peers were talking about one more than the other.
* In some cases, the person might also be Jewish, be of Middle Eastern descent, or have a close friend who is. This gives them a personal connexion to the conflict. It's certainly not limited that, but it happens, and though you'll encounter a lot of white people who don't have an explanation like this (me, for instance), the percentage of people who at least know either a Jewish or Middle Eastern person is probably fairly high in some places.

Then, once you start looking into Israel--Palestine, you find so much material, so many different stories, and it branches out into so many other topics, that it can easily keep you occupied for a long time. It leads to discussion and debate about the history of the region, which is told differently depending on whom you ask; to talking about how we feel about our history of imperialism and colonialism, what impact these high-level policy decisions made by diplomats and emperors in fancy rooms could have on the lives of powerless people in villages far away, and what obligation we have to deal with the lingering effects of past injustice, and how; to talking about international law, the laws of armed conflict, how they're interpreted, how they should be enforced, and whether our current international laws are perfect and should be deferred to at all times or whether they might actually have problems or limitations; and even to discussing fundamental questions about the very nature of a country or a national identity---like, what does it mean to be a Palestinian? What is a valid or invalid basis on which to found a country?

## Intuitions

Let's take a few steps back. Imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine and you're approaching it for the first time, intent on forming a position. You have no bias about it, you haven't been influenced to think one way or another, you're just a normal person who doesn't hate Jews or Muslims. If you started looking into the topic today, or perhaps a few years ago before the recent war escalated, what would be your initial impression? It depends. The conflict triggers different intuitions depending on who's examining it. We aren't bound to those first intuitions, but many people never move past them, because most people have better things to do than thoroughly challenge own intuitions about a complex topic like this. Regardless, what sort of thoughts come to mind for you? Let's consider some possibilities.

#### 1. Favour the side that does less bad stuff.

If it's a war between two sides, then maybe we should just ask which side is morally worse. If you look at Israel and then at groups like Hamas or Hezbollah, there's a lot about each of them to lead a normal person to figure Israel is less bad---perhaps not angels, but further from devils. They have a better system of government, better laws, better culture, they do better on women's rights, gay rights, religious tolerance, freedom of speech, democracy, adherence to international norms. Who would rather side with the Islamist fascists? I'd much rather live in Tel Aviv.

#### 2. Choose the side that aligns with us.

If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and wants to be our friend and is happy to work with us, and is a generally valuable asset in our broader goals in the region, then maybe we should shrug and pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is a good ally to the West, and if we decided that wasn't important anymore, it's not like we could feasibly switch sides anyway because Israel's enemies all hate us. This, realistically, it how many people are approaching the issue (including all our politicians). "Israel wants to be our friend, and the people who they're fighting hate us, ergo Israel is the side we're on; the end."

#### 3. Favour the underdog.

With great power comes great responsibility. If one side of a conflict is far more wealthy and powerful than the other, then they're the ones who are really in control, and they have a greater responsibility to act properly and direct the conflict in a moral way. In this case, Israel is holding all the cards while the Palestinians are oppressed, so if the state of things is unacceptable, then Israel is the country we should be blaming and expecting to make a change. This is another common perspective with a broad psychological appeal.

#### 4. Defend the native population.

If we're invading a country and taking over the native people there, then we're the baddies, right? It probably doesn't become okay just because we can find some aspect of their culture we find immoral, which is, indeed, a tactic that colonialists utilized, like with widow-burning in India, or human sacrifice in Mesoamerica.

This is an intuition that you can cast onto the Middle East, as some people view Israel a country of people who are foreign to the area and therefore colonizers, whereas Palestinians are the natives who were there first. This means before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same piece of land, Israel has less legitimacy, and Palestinians are in the right in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as an extension of a broader Western interest in having some levers of power in the Middle East, which could be something a person opposes, especially if their political views are especially far left.

In actuality, many Israelis are not "foreigners" at all, even if we ignore that this region is where Jewish people originated long ago. In the early years of Zionism, there were a lot of Jewish settlers from Europe who helped increase the population, but today the majority are Jews born in Israel, many of them descended from Jewish families that fled to Israel from elsewhere in the Middle East, meaning they're not even of European origin. Nonetheless, this intuition is persuasive for some people.

#### 5. Oppose Jewish influence.

Jewish people have long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the West, there are people whose view of Israel is they're manipulators, that they attacked the USS *Liberty*, that they had something to do with 9/11, they use their control of media companies and AIPAC to control American foreign policy, they want to drag us into wars in the Middle East for their own benefit. They side against Israel in their conflict with the Arab world because they think of Israelis as nefarious Jews whom they want nothing to do with. This is more common among right-wing people, especially conspiracy theorists, though many of their memes and arguments have infected the left as well.

#### 6. Be mindful of our prejudice.

Liberal people try to be self-aware about the danger of bias and prejudice, and compensate for that in their evaluation of things. In the Israel--Palestine conflict they may see a danger of siding with Israelis because Palestinians are poorer, they're Muslims, and they're seen as less "white" than Jews (because of how European Jews are portrayed in Western media---in actuality, many Jews look more like other Middle Eastern peoples). To counteract this prejudice hazard, Jews are placed under a higher level of scrutiny, because we're trying to self-reflect and check ourselves. So in practice, this works out in the Palestinians' favour.

#### 7. Anti-American bias.

A far-left tendency is to oppose the US exerting control around the world. They criticize everything that happens in international affairs through the lens of wanting to reduce the American sphere of influence. In the Israel--Palestine conflict, they view Israel as an extension of American interests, or as a puppet of the US, being used as a divide to destabilize the Middle East for our own purposes. Israel's very existence is therefore opposed, and the countries that want to destroy Israel are often favoured. The people who fall into this also hate Saudi Arabia (an American ally) and hate Iran and China (American enemies).

Of these, which intuition(s) do you find most appealing? When I first began trying to sort out all my thoughts about this conflict, the one that affected my thinking the most was the first example I listed: "choose the side that does less bad stuff". That's just part of how I navigate conflicts. If you were to tell me a war just broke out between two factions in any other random country on the planet and I had to take a side, I would start by asking which faction is less evil.

In applying that lens to Israel--Palestine, I made the following observations:

* Israel's government is something like a middling European democracy---flawed, but aspiring in the right direction. They have freedom of speech, they allow vocal criticism of the government, you're allowed to form opposition parties and vote the current government out of power. Their military is also held to a far higher standard than any other in the region. There are some problematic aspects of Israeli society, but in terms of its overall character, it's far less oppressive than average for this part of the world.
* The terrorist groups Israel is at war with aren't seeking freedom; they're basically fascists. They want to implement an authoritarian, theocratic society powered by radical Islam. And in their fight to destroy Israel, they have virtually no ethics, they have no respect for international law, they have no regard for civilian deaths, no, all bets are off, they're willing to do anything it takes to win. This is not a normal "resistance movement", it's a resistance movement that's been hijacked by crazy people.
* Hamas and other Islamist groups openly proclaim their goal is not ending the occupation of Palestine, but the eradication of Jews and the complete destruction of Israeli society. They say not death to Israelis, but death to the Jews---and that's not a mistake; they're well aware of the distinction. They aren't against Arab Israelis, and non-Israeli Jews don't get a pass. If they got their way, they would carry out a second Holocaust.

For me, this formed a reasonable basis for leaning toward support for Israel, but I still had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort to brutality *after decades of injustice* cancel out that initial injustice? No. If Israel is imposing unjust conditions onto the Palestinians, then any intuition about Israel seeming to operate in a more moral way in the present can't be the end of the story.

If you aren't sure what I mean, imagine a slave society where some people are owned as property. A group of rebel slaves break free and rampage through the streets. They kill whole families, they rape women, they laugh while doing it. I could say these rebels had done something immoral, and that would be true---but their actions being immoral doesn't speak to whether the conditions of slavery were justified to begin with. It would be a mistake to let that distract me from also condemning the latter, which is actually the far greater crime overall.

An immoral thing can appear better than it is when it becomes part of a system that legitimizes it through rules and procedure, and people grow used to it over time. What if the system itself is evil? What if we've grown accustomed to evil? This is what the Palestinian cause demands we investigate. Is there something abhorrent and unacceptable about the status quo, like slavery, that Palestinians are forced to endure, and which it would be wrong of us to overlook while condemning the latest Hamas attack?

## The history of the conflict

Even before Nazi Germany, Jews were mistreated in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904), a Jewish man born in what is today Budapest, founded modern **Zionism** by proposing (in 1895) that Jews should unite and form a state of their own, rather than try to assimilate to their host nations, as many Jews were then attempting. Herzl came to believe that Jews could never truly feel secure living as a minority in Christian Europe, where Jews were, despite their best efforts, forever victims of antisemitism, treated with suspicion, called aliens and outsiders, used as scapegoats, and periodically massacred in pogroms that destroyed whole Jewish communities. It was just one tragedy after another going back centuries. The movement Herzl started lived on in the decades after his early death, and the case for his proposal would only become stronger as events unfolded.

Zionism was a secular movement, focused less on Judaism as a religion and more on the Jews as a people. It was named after Zion, or Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, which was poetically as a metonym for Jerusalem itself, or for all of Israel, via the ancient kingdom of Israel. The name signified that if Jewish people were to have a homeland, it ought to be in the place their people were from historically, which was, indisputably, the region of Palestine, where once were the ancient Jewish kingdoms of Israel and Judea, where Soloman's Temple was built in 957 BC to house the Ark of the Covenant, from which the Jews were exiled to Babylon (modern Iraq) and have been living as a diaspora in various countries ever since.

But in the late 19th century, for the Jews to create a state in Palestine wasn't yet feasible. Two important events created opportunity, the second being the displacement of Jews from much of Europe by Nazi Germany, and the first being **World War I** (1914--1918). As a consequence of WWI, the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled a large part of the Middle East from its capital in Constantinople, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides of the war, and Britain supporting an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule (1916). The following year, with WWI still ongoing, Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary and former Prime Minister, declared that, after the war, Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in a region called Palestine, then under Ottoman control. His letter of support to the Jewish community is now known as the **Balfour declaration**. It was deliberately vague, not defining its terms or specifying an exact location, region size, or proposed boundaries. It was simply to be "in Palestine".

There were already problems. A year before the Balfour declaration, Britain made promises to Arab leaders to recognize Arab independence after the war---though, like the Balfour declaration, their promises weren't very specific, and people would later argue over the correct interpretation of what either side even really said. This traces back to a series of letters in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahon--Hussein correspondence**, between British diplomat Henry McMahon and Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi (1854--1931), the Sharif of Mecca who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. A proponent of pan-Arabism (a desire for all Arab nations to form a single Arab state), Hussein declared himself caliph after the war, but detested the Balfour declaration and refused to coÃ¶perate with the British (e.g. he refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles). This eventually led to the British supporting Ibn Saud, who in 1925 conquered Hejaz and took Mecca, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

20-8.png|The Sykes--Picot Agreement (modern borders faded)

In 1916, Britain also made a secret agreement with France and other countries called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement**, which would partition control of Ottoman territory in the Levant after the war. There would be areas directly under British control, some under French control, and some Arab states but divided into English and French spheres of interest. Palestine, because it contained sites of religious and cultural significance to Jews and Muslims, was going to be carved out separately and put under international control of some kind, with the details varying as the agreement went through different iterations. These talks meant Britain couldn't promise lands north of the Sykes--Picot line, where French influence began. In 1920, despite any earlier plans, the United Nations gave Britain an explicit mandate to control Palestine until it could become self-governing, and it became known as **Mandatory Palestine** while under British control. This was arguably not inconsistent with what was committed to in the McMahon--Hussein correspondence, in which McMahon did not unconditionally promise all Arab-speaking places, but only of "those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France".

After WWI, the Ottoman empire had lost its Arabian territories and was in a state of near-collapse, its power mostly limited to the Anatolian plateau around Constantinople, and the Allies were trying to prosecute members of the Ottoman government for their role in the Armenian genocide (1915--17). The Ottoman Sultan who ruled throughout most of WWI, Mehmed V, had just died shortly before the end of the war, and his half-brother, Mehmed VI, inherited the situation. What little power MehMed VI had was then challenged by the rising Turkish Nationalist movement, led by AtatÃ¼rk, the man himself. Allied forces then occupied Constantinople, and so began the **Turkish War of Independence** (1919--23), in which Turkish Nationalists fought to repel the Allies from the country, formally ended the Ottoman Empire (1922), and established the modern republic of Turkey (1923). (Constantinople was officially renamed to Istanbul in 1930.)

A lot was changing in the world. Countries were rising and falling, borders being redrawn, and in the background, millions of normal people were picking up their lives and migrating to avoid conflict and to be part of the communities of their choice. In the interwar period (1918--39), tens of thousands of Jewish people continued migrating into Mandatory Palestine, settling new towns, developing farmland, but also leading to conflict and tension with the Arab population in that area. The British even limited how many Jews were allowed to migrate to the region in the 20s because they noticed it was leading to problems, and it was still their responsibility to keep the peace. Though some Jewish people had always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to them at this time was exacerbated by the perception they were Europeans, foreigners coming into the region from abroad---a tragically ironic fate for the Jews, considered aliens both in Europe and in the Levant. (In the following decades, many Jews throughout the rest of the Middle East would flee persecution to Israel, and so Israel became less "European" the more time went by.)

20-2.png|UN Res. 181 (passed 1947)|A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region---not carelessly in half, but with respect to the existing population and its demography while trying to create a Jewish-majority region per the wishes of the Zionist movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would end up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' would've been only barely majority-Jewish. In other words, they put as many Muslims as possible into the Jewish side without going over half, then gave the rest to Muslims as well. On the other hand, this resulted in the Jewish side having more land per person. The city of Jerusalem, with its historical and religious importance to both Jews and Muslims, would become a "special international zone".

Arabs viewed the partition plan as unfairly benefitting the Jews. They boycotted participation in the negotiations, and refused to accept any partition plan proposed. The UN passed the resolution anyway (1947), and fighting between Jews and Muslims broke out across the country (1948 Palestine war), but British forces did little to intervene and simply began withdrawing from the region, leaving everybody to fend for theirselves. Just as the British Mandate officially ended, the newly constituted State of Israel declared its independence (1948-05-14), and both sides prepared for war. The armies of all surrounding Arab countries---Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen---would invaded the region (1948 Israel--Palestine war), but Israel fought back and somehow held its own, leading to a stalemate in 1949, and then to all countries involved signing an armistice agreement in 1949. The armistice lines (where the armies on both sides were pushed up to when the fighting stopped) became the de facto borders of Israel for the next few decades. Notably, the city of Jerusalem was cut in half, with Israel controlling the west and Jordan controlling the east.

For Israelis, this was a victory. They had to fight for it, lives were lost, and they didn't get all the territory they hoped for, but they finally had a country to call their own. It was even in their ancestral homeland, where they had access to historical religious sites, including the literal hill they call 'Mount Zion' (though the Temple Mount, site of the first temple built by King Soloman, considered the holiest site in Judaism, remained under Jordan's control in East Jerusalem until 1967).

However, as part of the fighting in the first part of the 1948 war, Israeli forces attacked Muslim Arabs all across the territory they controlled, and hundreds of Palestinian villages were looted and destroyed. In total, by the end of it, around 700,000 Arabs had fled or were directly expelled, most of them going to the remaining Palestinian territories then controlled by Egypt and Jordan, where they built new lives as refugees. Arabs today refer to this year of violent displacement as **the Nakba** (Arabic for *catastrophe*), which became the uniting story of Palestinian identity.

^1. The full McMahon--Hussein correspondence can be read [here](mcmahon-hussein-correspondence.html).
* A caliph is a Muslim ruler who claims to be the successor to the prophet Muhammad, and therefore implicit leader of the entire Muslim world. The region ruled by a caliph is called a caliphate, and there have been many caliphates throughout history. The Ottoman Sultan was generally considered a caliph, including by Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi, and the Ottoman Empire could also have been called the Ottoman Caliphate (though for various reasons this wasn't officially used).
* In modern English, "mount" is often associated with mountains, like Mount Everest or Mount Fuji, but in the past it was used more loosely for any elevated ground. The hill called "Mount Zion" wasn't an important geographical feature; it was noteworthy because that's where they built the city of Jerusalem. Nobody knows what "Zion" originally meant, beyond that it was the name people used for that area.

## The pro-Israeli, Western perspective

Why have so many people in the West been pro-Israel for so long? A big part of it is they had a compelling, heroic narrative. The Jews were a powerless, persecuted minority, victims of the most terrible genocide of all time. Even after liberating them from the Nazis, many powerful Western countries didn't care about them. Jewish refugees were turned away, rejected, and continued to be treated badly. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. How could they? So they united, they came together in solidarity and resistance, and the created their own space where they could feel safe and have autonomy. They were attacked, but they persevered and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who wanted them all dead. It was glorious, the ultimate comeback story.

Today, the underdog mentality benefits Palestinians, but during the Cold War, it played for Israel. Just look at them on a map, surrounded by larger countries with bigger populations. Israel was the underdog in the Middle East. And while the rest of the world was fighting for democracy against the threat of Communism, Israel was on our side. They were the only democracy in the Middle East, while significant parts of the Arab world, like Egypt and Syria, were allied with the Soviets. The USSR distributed anti-Zionist propaganda depicting the Jews as puppets of the US, and supported the Palestinian cause, especially into the 1970s when both the US and USSR became more directly invested in the conflict.

Israel's victories felt like our victories. They were our friend, beating up our enemies. That's how it felt for people alive at the time. And then Reagan told Gorbachev to tear down that wall, everybody clapped, the USSR fell apart, the American space program put a man on the moon, there was Elvis, Michael Jackson, rock and roll, Sunday morning football, a good paying job down at the plant, and it all blurs together into this collective memory a time when it kicked ass to be American. Then 9/11 happened. The American public was completely unprepared for the trauma that having a foreign enemy attack them on their own territory would inflict. Suddenly everybody realized there was a group of people called Muslims, and they didn't like them or want to see them on airplanes. The lesson was that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, Muslims were the ones who hated you and burned the American flag, so apparently Jews are on our side, becausea enemy of my enemy and all that.

But now we're getting into a generational divide. If you were born in the late 90s or onward, you might barely remember 9/11 or what the world was like before it. For you, Israel was just some country on the other side of the world that all your politicians felt the need to mention when trying to get your parents to vote for them, and then you looked it up and learned it was doing some bad stuff. Israel is now wealthy and powerful, and the big countries they're surrounded by aren't really enemies anymore. Now they're just fighting small militias along its border. They're not the underdogs anymore. We see footage of Israeli soldiers, and we look at the neighbourhoods in Gaza, and suddenly it feels like Israel is the oppressor bullying the little guys. The fight has been reframed from "Israel vs. all the Arab countries" to just "Israel vs. the Palestinians", and now the Palestinians are the underdogs.

## The Arab perspective

20-10.png|The Kaaba in Mecca

In Western Arabia, along the eastern coast of the Red Sea, there is **Mecca**, the holiest city in Islam, birthplace of the prophet Muhammad, and location of the Kaaba, the cube-shaped Mosque that millions of Muslims make a pilgrimage to visit each year, and in whose direction all Muslims around the world face daily in prayer. For centuries, Mecca was controlled by the (non-Arab) Ottoman Empire, though often through a vassal-state called the Sharifate of Mecca. (A Sharifate means rule by a *Sharif*, a religious leader who claims to be descended from the prophet Muhammad's grandson.)

In 1908, **Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi** was appointed to be the new Sharif of Mecca. Hussein grew critical of the Ottoman Empire as the Young Yurk Revolution earlier that year resulted in a party called the **Committee of Union and Progress** gaining significant power, existing alongside and eventually usurping almost all *de facto* power from the sultan. The CUP then began persecuting non-Turkish ethnic minorities as part of their goal to "Turkify" the region, leading to the Armenian genocide on order of the CUP's leader, Talaat Pasha, during which Hussein helped save thousands of Armenians.

After WWI started, Hussein learned the CUP planned on deposing him, so he sided with the Allies. Britain, meanwhile, was trying to maintain the support of the Muslim world after Mehmed V declared a holy war against them in 1914, calling on all Muslims living in Allied-controlled countries to revolt in support of the Ottomans (many did). These factors led to the *quid pro quo* in the McMahon--Hussein correspondence, and to Hussein launching the **Arab Revolt** against the Ottomans in 1916. Hussein then declared himself king of all Arab countries, though the Allies didn't accept this and recognized him only as the king of a new country called Hejaz. After the Ottoman Empire was formally dissolved in 1924, Hussein declared himself the new caliph, with the support of the now-deposed Ottoman caliph, Mehmed VI. Though he was forced to abdicate from his position the following year after being attacked by Ibn Saud (which is why Saudi Arabia controls Mecca today), Hussein still had a significant influence as the "father of pan-Arabism", and his sons became the kings of Iraq (Faisal I, r. 1921--33) and Jordan (Abdullah I, r. 1921--51).

20-11.png|Israel, cutting the Arab world in half

Not all Arab states were immediately advocates of pan-Arabism (as in forming a singular Arab super-country), but they were embracing Arab unity and rejecting Western powers interfering in the Arab world. They felt betrayed by the West after, instead of leaving and allowing the region to be controlled by the Arab forces that had just helped them overthrow the Ottomans, Britain and the United Nations wanted to install a Jewish state, populated by tens of thousands of settlers from Europe, right in the heart of the Middle East. It turns out this is what they were planning even before Hussein started his revolt. The UN proposed the borders of this new Jewish state would stretch all the way down to the Gulf of Aqaba, dividing the Arab world in two. It meant you couldn't get from the Sinai to Arabia without going through Israeli territory. Muslims in Egypt, then the most powerful Arab country, would no longer be able to travel to Mecca by land without the Jews' permission.

From the Arab perspective, the whole situation was already objectionable before any fighting started. The creation of Israel, in that location, with those borders, without any Arab states being consulted? Then when Jewish militants began attacking the Muslim community in Palestine (in 1948), and expelling thousands from their homes, creating a refugee crisis in the region, the Arab powers knew they had to react. This couldn't go on. A few years prior, in 1945, the **Arab League** had been formed, headquartered in Egypt. Its founding member-states weren't ready to surrender their sovereignty, but through the Arab League declared their intent to coÃ¶perate and strengthen their ties, and expressed jointly, through the League's charter, their dissatisfaction with the lack of independence granted to Palestine after WWI. This is why a few years later, when Israel declared its independence in 1948, all the Arab League's founding members (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Syria) attacked Israel together as a united front.

For decades, every Arab country refused to officially recognize Israel, some still don't, considering it nothing more than an illegitimate occupier of Arab land, a thorn in their side they couldn't get rid of. That's why their position was not one of compromise, but the demand that Israel be completely dissolved. Why settle for less? This only began changing a generation or so later, with the Camp David Accords in 1978, when Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with and recognize Israel, to the chagrin of their fellow Arab League members. Eventually, Palestine itself, and then Jordan, would do the same.

### Putting the Nakba in perspective

The initial grievance that still fuels the conflict today concerns the 1948 expulsion of 700,000 people from Israel, which the Arab world calls the Nakba. How do we understand this number and the scale of impact these expulsions made? It's smaller than most major cities. It's about half the size of the Bronx. It's roughly the same as the current metro populations of Leicester, England; Madison, Wisconsin; Dresden, Germany; or London, Ontario. So imagine if we kicked out every single person from one of those places. The only time this sort of thing happens in the West is when there's a natural disaster. Hurricane Katrina, the cyclone that hit the US Gulf coast in 2005, stands as the most significant example. It temporarily displaced 1.5 million people, and though most were able to return eventually, around 100,000 never did, in many cases because their homes were completely destroyed and they rebuilt their lives elsewhere. Even if 7 times that amount were permanently displaced instead, to match the Nakba in scale, it doesn't feel the same because the people displaced by Katrina who didn't return to their old towns weren't forcibly prevented from doing so if they really wanted to, nor was there a conscious entity for us to blame and hold accountable for the storm's destruction.

We could look to other population transfers that took place in the 20th century. The largest was the partition of British India, creating the modern India and Pakistan, wherein roughly 15 million people moved in one direction or the other (Muslims to Pakistan and Bangladesh, Hindus and Sikhs to India), and another million or so people died in the process, as chaos and violence erupted all across the countryside. In a case like this, it's difficult to say how many people were forced out, how many left out of fear but actually would've been fine if they stayed, and how many left voluntarily, perhaps even enthusiastically, because they wanted to be part of the other country. But it's safe to say the number of people coerced was more than zero, and this shouldn't understood as a voluntary migration. Here again though, it still doesn't feel the same, because while many people were displaced and forced to rebuild their lives elsewhere, it was a two-street that displaced people on both sides, and it was entirely chaotic mob violencee (neither government had a policy of making anyone leave anywhere), whereas the Israeli expuslions were carried out by the Israeli military.

The closest comparison with Arabs being expelled from Israel might be ethnic Germans being expelled from the rest of Central Europe after World War II, affecting an estimated 12 million people between 1944 and 1950. It happened in the same few years, and for a similar reason (people of the side who lost a war getting kicked out of the countries that defeated them). Regardless of what we choose as our comparison, a thought comes to mind: in all these other cases, nobody is still fighting about it today. And that's not surprising. Why would they be? If we did permanently expel every single person from one of the cities I mentioned earlier, I'd expect the people affected to be upset, but I wouldn't expect their great-grandchildren to still be waging war over it 80 years later. How is it possible that these people haven't built new lives elsewhere in the Middle East and moved on from all this by now?

## Why is the conflict still ongoing?

The Arabs who were expelled from Israel aren't alive anymore. The Israeli leadership responsible for the expulsions aren't alive anymore either. Is it not our responsibility to try and move on, to not get stuck in a loop fighting our ancestors' battles forever? There are many other people who have lived through massacres and expulsions, who have suffered generational trauma, who have had the whole history of their people forever changed by suffering persecution---just look at the Jews, for example---and yet they eventually make peace and coÃ«xist with the descendants of those those who harmed them.

But that's supposing the oppression stops at some point. I could make peace with the grandchildren of the population that enslaved my ancestors, but not if slavery is still ongoing and I'm still a slave. And for the Arab world, the unacceptable condition that needed to stop---the thing they couldn't allow theirselves to make peace with---was not active aggression, violence, or slavery, but Israel's very existence in the region, as a country occupying land they felt Israelis had no right to declare independence on in the first place. If the fighting stops and everybody calms down and moves on, that means Israel 'got away with it'.

This is understandable if you think about it in a certain way. Imagine if a neighbour stole something of yours, and then suggested to make peace---but without giving back what they stole. Of course, you would reject this and make the return of your property a condition of your forgiveness. But if we translate this logic into the realm of international relations, where does that take us? Even if we say Israel's declaration of independence was 'stealing' rightfully 'Arab land', this is not a crime of which you could accuse the millions of people living in Israel generations later. It's not an 'occupation' when it's where they live, and they have families and raise children there, and then *their* children have children there, and so on. We can't show up generations later and kick them all out and say "you must be removed from here, the only home you've ever known, because your great-grandfather had no right to be here in the first place". Where does this thinking lead? No, there can be no question that Israel *is* the rightful home for the vast majority of people who inhabit it today.

If, on the other hand, you have a more 'blood and soil' way of viewing politics, as though land can have some spiritual connection with a certain ethnicity, then I must remind you that Zionists are making the same argument, and Israel is, undoubtedly, where the Jews came from, and from longer ago than whoever came after---who one could say were occupying spiritually Jewish land that was unjustly taken from them. That's why Palestine was the place Jews were so keen on being when they declared their state, because for them it was indeed 'returning'. But even if they had taken some random territory in, say, Brazil, or somewhere else they had no connection to, you can't rewind and destroy an existing country on the grounds that it's a colony or settlement whose founding you'd have opposed if we could go back in time. It's too late that for.

Nor is this even generally a serious argument against a country in a world where most of them formed by taking land the previous owner didn't voluntarily offer to them. None of the surrounding countries are expected to survive that type of auditing. The elephant in room is that it's a special standard applied to Israel because they're Jews. If this were an Arab Muslim country that expelled a bunch of people who were attacking them after they survived a war, nobody would still be fighting about this today. They'd mark it as a bad event in the history books and they'd negotiate some kind of peace settlement and everybody would be over it by now. What kept the fire burning was Israel's status as a Jewish-majority nation with Western-aligned values that had no place in the pan-Arab vision of the Middle East. This is probably why no other non-Arab or non-Muslim minority group in the region is allowed to have independence either.

And this has already become the perspective of the Arab world. I speak primarily to antisemitic radicals in the West when I make such observations. After the first while, Arab leaders began realizing it was unreasonable to demand the wholesale dissolution of Israeli society forever. That's not what Palestinians today ask for. That's not what other Arab states are pursuing. It's just a radical pipedream at this point.

The more interesting demand is that Palestinians who are descendants of those who were removed from the region in 1948 should be allowed to return to Israel. In principle, this would be the right thing to do, but its political viability has been complicated by the events between the expulsions and now. How do I allow back into my neighbourhood people who seem to actively want me dead? There *are* millions of Arabs living in Israel already, but Israelis have good reason to believe that if they opened the flood gates for all people in Palestine today, the result would be mass conflict between this population and their own---without exaggeration, some of those people would be happy to slaughter random Jews in the street. An agreement to resettle that population is something that might've been negotiated years ago, but it would've required peace and diplomacy, and assurations to the Jewish population---who are outnumbered in the Middle East, and historically a persecuted people who have come together to pursue political agency for their own protection.

That is the issue which underlies much of the conflict: the distrust that Zionist Jews feel toward the idea they would be safe in a country that's controlled by some other group. It's not impossible that a majority-Muslim country would be perfectly fair and just in its treatment of Jews, but the Zionist claim is they shouldn't be forced to accept that gamble---and as observers, we can say there's a good case to be made that it's a gamble they wouldn't win, considering the violence, terrorism, and outright antisemitism among the population that such a solution is asking them to welcome onto their streets.

## Timeline (1948--2022)

So far, I went over the history leading up to Israel's founding in 1948 to offer an understanding of the origin of the conflict. The events between there and the present are less interesting or relevant to the opinions or arguments I wanted to make, but I'll quickly run through this to catch us up to the present.

* After Israel was established, Jewish communities were targetted in revenge all across the Muslim world. Today it's estimated that about 900,000 Jews fled or were expelled throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In some of these countries virtually the entire Jewish population left, with none remaining today. The majority of them resettled to Israel, though some also moved to Western countries like France and the US. The majority of Israelis today are the descendants of these Jews who fled to Israel after its founding, not the European settlers who came in the 1920s.
* In 1951, Abdullah I, the first King of Jordan and son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca, was assassinated while visiting Jordan-occupied Jerusalem. The assassin was shot and killed instantly, but the common interpretation is that he opposed Abdullah for his being too friendly with Israel, and for annexing the West Bank after the 1948 war, despite absorbing the Palestinian population as Jordanian citizens. This wasn't the end of the conflict between Jordan and Palestine.
* In 1964, the Arab League helped to found the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (PLO). In the beginning, the PLO was a militant group that engaged in irregular violence while demanding the complete dissolution of Israel. In 1965, the political party **Fatah** was formed by Yasser Arafat and others. To this day, Fatah is the largest faction within the PLO. Arafat would become a major figure in Palestine, and by the late 80s had led the PLO to a less extreme position, trying to negotiate with rather than destroy Israel. He claimed Israel had a right to exist by 1988.

20-14.png|The Straits of Tiran
20-15.png|The territory Israel captured in the Six-Day War

* In 1967, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser said he would close the Straits of Tiran, meaning Egypt would block ships from going through the southern part of the Gulf of Aqaba, cutting off Israel from international waters. Israel said this would be a *casus belli*, and Egypt agreed, preparing their army for war as they did it anyway. The resulting conflict became known as the **Six-Day War**, which Israel won. As a result, Israel took control of the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the whole Sinai Peninsula.
* As an aside (not directly involving Israel): after the Six-Day War, PLO militants had relocated to Jordan. In 1970, a conflict erupted called Black September, a civil war in which some parts of the PLO tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Jordanian monarchy.
* There was another war in 1973 called the **Yom Kippur War**, so called because it began with a surprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. It lasted a few weeks and as a result, Israel agreed to return control of the Sinai to Egypt, but continued its occupation of Golan, Gaza, and the West Bank.
* In 1978, the **Camp David Accords** were signed by Israel and Egypt in the United States (at Camp David). The follow year, Israel and Egypt signed an explicit peace treaty (simply called the Egypt--Israel peace treaty) in Washington, D.C., in which Egypt recognized Israel as a legitimate state, agreed to keep the Sinai demilitarized, recognized they had no right to block Israel from going through the Gulf of Aqaba nor the Straits of Tiran, and granted Israeli ships safe passage through the Suez canal. Israel was then supposed to withdraw from all the territory it had captured after the Six-Day War. This treaty upset much of the Arab world. Egypt was suspended from the Arab League, of which it had been the leading member. In 1981, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat was assassinated, and the common belief is this was motivated by Islamist radicals who opposed Sadat pursuing peace with Israel and the United States.
* In 1987--91, there was an uprising among Palestinians now known as the First Intifada (from the Arabic for *uprising*).
* In 1993 and 1995, Israel and the PLO signed agreements negotiated in Oslo, Norway, called the **Oslo Accords** (Oslo I signed in America and Oslo II signed in Egypt). As a result, the PLO officially recognized Israel as a legitimate country, and Israel officially recognized the PLO as the legitimate authority representing the Palestinian people. This also resulted in the Palestine Authority being created, a semi-autonomous government . The United Nations Security Council also adopted Resolution 242, which demanded that Israel withdraw from the territories it occupied as a result of the Six-Day War. They had already withdrawn from the Sinai, so that left the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.
* In 2000--05, there was another uprising, known aptly as the Second Intifada.
* Yasser Arafat, the long-time Palestinian leader who founded Fatah in 1959 and led the PLO since 1969, died in 2004. The PLO chairman since then has been Mahmoud Abbas.
* In 2005, Israel fully withdrew from Gaza, leaving it to the control of the Palestine Authority, whose legislative council was controlled by Fatah. In 2006, an election was held in Gaza that resulted in a different organization, **Hamas**, winning a majority of seats. It was a surprising outcome: despite getting nearly the same number of votes as Fatah, they won twice as many seats and ended up with full control of government. A civil war then broke out in 2007 between Hamas and Fatah called the Battle of Gaza, in which Fatah officials were imprisoned, exiled from the region, or killed. There hasn't been an election since the one in 2006. So from 1995--2006, Palestine was united under the Palestine Authority; after 2006, Palestine has been split between the Palestine Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza.
* Israel already had some control of land crossings into Gaza, but in 2009 began a naval blockade as well.

#### This brings us to the situation as we knew it in 2022.

Israel still controls the Golan Heights, an illegal occupation they agreed to withdraw from, but in popular discourse very few people seem to care about that.

The Gaza Strip is a densely-populated, independent region with access only to the Egyptian and Israeli borders, and to the Mediterranean Sea. Israel doesn't actively occupy Gaza, but the IDF can basically grant itself access any time it wants to do military operations there. This situation is generally described as unfair and something that needs to be addressed, but that's difficult to do while Hamas controls the region.

The West Bank is governed by the PA/Fatah/PLO, but is also effectively under Israeli military occupation.

**Israeli settlers** have meanwhile been randomly moving into the area to build homes and develop their own civilian communities, with the intention of laying claim to the land. Everybody recognizes this to be illegal. They do it because the West Bank is land that used to be part of the Jewish kingdom of Israel historically (they even refer to it as "Judea and Samaria", the names of biblical territories the West Bank roughly corresponds to), and they view theirselves as having an historical right to the area.

Every so often, the Israeli government uses the presence of Israelis in some part of the West Bank as justification for declaring that that land now belongs to Israel. This happened again in March 2024, when Israel declared that [another 8 square kilometres was now theirs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/22/israel-largest-west-bank-settlement-blinken-visit/).

The Israeli minister who made the announcement, Bezalel Smotrich, is a notorious far-right politician who encourages these settlements, and he was born, raised, and still lives in an illegal settlement himself. He simply doesn't care whether it's illegal.

If Israel is declaring that some parts of the West Bank are henceforth part of Israel, that implies they view the rest of the West Bank as not Israel. So it's not their land currently, and what they're doing is not 'settling' so much as annexing territory they acknowledge is not theirs, while fighting to prevent the people and government who do control this territory from having international recognition, autonomy of decision-making, or doing anything to stop them. How can any of this be justified?

(And if somebody did view the West Bank as Israel, that raises other, different questions---such as, why are these people not citizens of Israel, and why do they live under different laws from everybody else? What's going on here? That view of things is not viable.)

Louis Theroux, documentary producer for the BBC, recently (April 2025) released *The Settlers*, a documentary about the Israelis creating settlements in the West Bank, which is an interesting look into their lives and motivations.

<i>Israel's settlements in the West Bank have all been declared illegal under international law. Many of its settlements are, however, authorized by the Israeli state. But then some of the settlements are not even authorized by the Israeli state and are illegal even by Israeli standards. These have come to be referred to as "settler outposts". That's what the term refers to if you see it used in Western media, such as when reporting on some of the [US sanctions placed on settler outposts in 2024](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/14/west-bank-settlement-sanctions-biden/).</i>

^Nasser, the Egyptian president who started the Six-Day War, resigned in shame after Egypt lost. But then he came back, and they kept fighting, and then Nasser died of a heart attack. Nasser arguably had some good qualities, but he was also authoritarian, sort of crazy, definitely an antisemite, said he didn't believe the Holocaust happened, and literally distributed copies of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Unfortunately---and not in a way that lends any legitimacy to Israel, mind you---a lot of Arabs around this time believed things like this. They were more like modern neo-Nazis than 'anti-colonialists'.

^The Six-Day War is so called because the first attack was on June 5 and the final attack was on June 10, meaning there were 6 distinct days on which fighting occurred. But this means from beginning to end, only 5 days passed. It reminds me of how we say that Jesus rose on the third day, but that means he died on Friday and rose on Sunday, two days later. It's the "third day" because we're counting the day he died, then the day after, then the day after. This difference in approach to counting days is like an [off-by-one error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error) in real life. I wonder if it's a regional difference and the same war would've been called the Five-Day War if it happened in Europe, because all the other wars I can think of that are named after durations (the Nine Years' War in 1688--97, the Seven Years' War in 1756--63) counted units inclusively.

## Analysis of the present

### Terrorism isn't unique to any population

It's important to remember no population is perfectly good. We're not above immoral actions ourselves. The depravity of Hamas is not a defect of their ethnicity nor of any other unique quality of theirs. We're better people because the generations before us managed to create peaceful, orderly societies, and we all had the privilege of growing up in that bubble of protection, learning about its virtues, having stable institutions to rely on, learning and internalizing good behaviour. If all that collapsed, things would change, adn some among us would reveal just how bad they can be.

In any sufficiently large population, there is a diverse range of psychologies, including people who are more willing than average to step on puppies. In Nazi Germany, who do you think guarded the camps? They didn't have to breed those Germans in a lab. They already existed among that population. If a dictatorship arose in any given country, there's going to be some percentage of people who turn out to support it. And if your country *doesn't* fall to dictatorship, those people will probably just carry on living normal lives, their potential for horrific action never being realized or activated without a certain environment to trigger it. They exist among us.

Haven't you ever met someone like this? I encounter them sometimes---a person about whom I later think, "If we lived in Nazi Germany, this guy might've worked at Dachau", or "If we lived in Nazi Germany, this guy would've ratted on his neighbours if he found out they were hiding Jewish children". It doesn't mean they're destined to become a serial killer in this life, but if the stars did align and he were called to action, he'd shrug and pull the trigger. And if he were born in a different part of the world, he might yell "allahu akbar" before he does.

I can imagine if my city were annexed by another country, that ruled over us in a way everybody thought unjust, and it went on for a long time, and we couldn't overpower this enemy through conventional means, and no other country or power intended to intervene. After some point, the people around me would become guerilla fighters, they would start militias, they would engage in irregular and unconventional warfare. They would probably be declared terrorists or something like this. And in those circumstances, the would-be psychopaths who walk among us might be of use. They might activate their potential to shrug and pull the trigger but channel it entirely toward this oppressive enemy. That is, in general, how I interpret extremist terror groups: something has gone dearly wrong, and the psychological underclass of their respective societies have been able to float to the surface and take things over.

It could happen anywhere. That was the great lesson of Nazi Germany.

**However...**

Not all armed resistance groups throw their morality out the window. And even among groups willing to do immoral things if that's what it takes to win, some are worse than others. The depths of cruelty and immorality that we see in some terrorist groups today was not an inevitability. They aren't dominoes with no agency. Their depravity is the result of choices they made, and which they could've made differently.

Palestinians deserve your empathy for wanting to fight. But the way in which some of these groups act is not something you should feel any need to justify or make excuses for, any more than you would for the Nazi leadership. They, too, had a narrative about how they'd been pushed around and treated unfairly by larger powers. Do we say they couldn't help theirselves, and the Treaty of Versailles made them do it?

Just because you consider yourself the victim doesn't mean you can't also become the villain. Perhaps that guy who beats his wife was bullied as a child. Everybody has a story for why they are the way they are. And feeling like everything you do is justified in your pursuit of vengeance is a dangerous mentality, but a powerful one in the service of evil. And that is what Hamas has become.

### Is Israel committing genocide?

The term *genocide* has important legal and political implications, which is why politicians will often avoid it, even if they're critical of what Israel is doing. The moment they utter it, they would triggering a different type of conversation. The rest of us are not so burdened, however, and in conversation "genocide" is used far more loosely, as though a general term for a mass killing, for which the non-genocide term is often "massacre". And it's not new for people to have disagreements about how to most accurately label mass killing events. Near the end of the Bosnian war, for example, Serbian forces killed around 8,000 Bosniaks in what some people call a genocide, but other people only refer to as a massacre. Noam Chomsky was one of these people, which is why some people called him a genocide denier---which isn't accurate, since he wasn't denying any of it happened; he only disagreed about what to call it.

For most people, though, "what is a genocide?" is an uninteresting question because it's not something they feel needs to be defined strictly or used carefully. It's about the spirit of the word and perhaps the quantity of people dying. Is Israel killing a lot of Palestinians? Yes? Then it's a genocide of Palestinians. That's the level on which we're often operating. Nor would people who feel strongly about the matter care to argue about the grey area. They would not change their mind about the conflict if it were somehow found that Israel's actions are similar to genocide but *technically* not. It would still be close enough, and you would likely be judged for bothering to quibble about where exactly the line is drawn.

The frequent counter-point is to ask: was World War II a genocide? We killed a lot of Germans. Was dropping nuclear bombs on Japan a genocide? There *are* people who answer yes, which is interesting; but the point is these actions weren't traditionally considered genocidal, despite being mass death events. A differentiator might be that Japan and Germany were military threats to us, which therefore made killing their people justified, if unfortunate. We could then say a genocide is not simply a mass killing, but an *unjustified* mass killing. But is Israel not under military threat? Do they not have justification to fight enemies that want to fight them? In this way the conversation moves to whether Israel is justified in what it's doing---or, perhaps, just *how much* of what it's doing could be justified. (It's noteworthy here that the genocide case against Israel among international organizations in Europe concedes that Israel is taking justified military action against Hamas, but asserts that Israel is *also* going above and beyond that, to do unjustified destruction to the population that may be characterized as genocidal.)

In comparison with the WWII examples, the focus is often the military--technological power disparity between the two sides. Hamas is probably not an existential threat in the same way that Nazi Germany was and retaliation against them is thus perceived as less justified, like an adult punching a child in the face because the child punched first. That framing would be upsetting for Israelis whose families were killed by the 'child' in question, but is still how many anti-Zionists perceive the conflict in the big picture.

In practice, many conversations don't reach that point. "Genocide" is often invoked because the speaker wants to wield the rhetorical power that it provides. This is useful for clarifying their own attitude about the situation, but effectively restricts the potential for dialogue. If an action is genocidal, then you can't be in favour of it, you can't make excuses for it, you can't even fail to properly condemn it---otherwise you're a genocide apologist (or something similar), and you can be dismissed, condemned, and your words ignored. In other words, once we've agreed to use the term "genocide", there is an an impenetrable veil of moral superiority that allows its user to put their brain on standby and not meaningfully engage with you any further. If Israel is doing genocide, then Israel is in the wrong, and that's the end of the conversation. It becomes black and white, simple, morally uncomplicated. And if all the facts were on their side, perhaps that rigid attitude would be justified. We don't have patience for somebody who seeks to minimize the Holocaust, for example---but that's because the dust has long settled, everything has been studied thoroughly, and it's such a clear-cut case that our choice of language to describe it is as unambiguous as could be.

For this reason, the question of whether Israel is committing "genocide" is sometimes a hill that people decide is worth dying on. To them this language becomes essential because if they can maintain it, they control and automatically "win" any conversation they enter. They'll begin an interaction by asking whether you consider the conflict a genocide. If you don't, they refuse to go any further until that's resolved. If you do, then the bulk of their work is done and what comes after that point is barely of any importance. At the end of the day you're either against the genocide (you agree with them) or you're not (you're evil and can be dismissed).

A more expansive sense of genocide has always been that it doesn't need to apply to a *genetic* group (as the word may seem to imply, coming from *gÃ©nos* + *-cide*, meaning race or tribe death), but to any discernible social identity. (On a related note, in anthropology an 'ethnicity' is not strictly a genetic cluster, despite that being the implied meaning for which the term is often used.) I often talk about people not as being consciously pro-genocide but as having a genocidal mindset. This is when a person says, essentially, "You know what? Fuck this other group of people. I just want them gone, I want them to disappear, so the world doesn't have to deal with their kind anymore."

Let's say the group in question were Buddhists and the mechanism of accomplishing this disappearance were to outlaw all aspects of Buddhist culture---destroy their temples, burn their books, take out their leaders or otherwise unifying voices---to a point where 'Buddhist' as an identifiable social class has disappeared from society. At the very least, one should consider this very similar to genocide, as if Buddhists *were* a genetic group, then the perpetrators of this attack may well have ended their genetic lineage instead, since the goal was the group's elimination. It only wasn't necessary here because they could make the group disappear through other means.

The term **cultural genocide** is used for when a society doesn't kill or sterilize every member of a certain group (thus ending their genetic lineage), but forcibly eliminates the social markers associated with a group's identity through forced assimilation or cultural repression---allowing the individuals to live, but still getting rid of the group from society. This is like the difference between removing a building through demolition and removing it by careful disassembly of every screw, beam, and panel, allowing us to recover and repurpose each one as a building material. Either way, the end result is the building is gone.

This is the sense in which it may be more appropriate to speak of a "transgender genocide"---not meaning the mass murder of trans people, but the creation of social rules, in society where trans people exist socially, that would effectively eliminate trans people as a social class. This could mean outlawing medical transition, outlawing crossdressing, reversing any gender changes issued for state identification, and restricting discourse or literature about the topic, perhaps labelling it subversive propaganda that's harmful to children. In short, it would mean forcing trans people to conform with their birth sex, making it impossible for them to *be* transgender any longer. This is the ultimate goal of people who possess a *genocidal mindset* toward the transgender population, i.e. they simply want trans people as a group to disappear and never be seen or heard from again. This is what was being expressed by the right-wing propagandist Michael Knowles when he got on stage at CPAC in 2023 and declared that he wanted to "eradicate transgenderism from society". If trans people *were* a genetic group, like Jews, Armenians, or Romani, and it were therefore possible to eliminate the group forever by getting rid of all current members, then that may be the route some people consider.

There's a difference between wanting to eliminate a group and wanting reform or change within the population in question. If somebody believes there's a problem with Romani people in their city, which is that they're prone to criminal behaviour like pickpocketing in busy tourist areas (a common trope about Romani migrants), they could make it their goal to do something about that, to help change the behaviour of the people in question, to figure out how to lower the crime rate in that community. That's more the level some people are at when it comes to gay or transgender people, or other communities as well. Criticism of a group---believing they have problems---isn't what I would describe as a genocidal mindset. A genocidal mindset is when you just want to get rid of them, not improve their situation. It can be crucial to not mix this up.

The question I've been leading up to is this: does Israel have a genocidal intent? There are people who believe a conscious and longstanding goal of Israel as a state is to eliminate the Palestinian population. They view all of Israel's actions through this lens. I'm sure that some Israelis who have come to hate the Palestinians and would like it if they could all be eliminated so Israel doesn't have to deal with them anymore. I'm equally if not more sure there are Palestinians who feel the same way about Jews. In both countries there are people born and raised into this conflict, who have lost family to the other side, who have been subjected to propaganda meant to frighten them of and dehumanize the other. However, I wouldn't assume that most people feel this way in either territory, nor does it seem to be the controlling perspective within Israel. That is, it doesn't seem as though the Israeli state or military is operating in pursuit of Palestinians as a group no longer existing. Nor do I see how any of the history or events up until this point could fairly be interpreted that way.

There can be signs of genocidal intent. The repression of identity and culture, the destruction of sites of religious or historical significance, the disruption of family ties, assimilation or otherwise repression of identity of children, restricting the use or teaching of other languages. Think of the way native peoples in North America were treated in the past, forcing their children away from the parents and then assimilating them into European society. Alternatively, look at the Russia--Ukraine war today, where it's been claimed (at the ICJ) that Russia is engaging in genocidal acts against the Ukrainian people (while falsely accusing Ukraine of genocide). Not only have tens of thousands died as a result of Russia's assault on their country, but we've heard Russian leaders denying that Ukrainians are even a real or distinct population, they've banned the Ukrainian language in areas they control, they've abducted Ukrainian children from their families and brought them back to Russia to be raised as Russians. This type of action is very alarming and speaks to the character of those making decisions in the conflict.

I would likewise be wholly condemnatory if there were any sign of Israeli forces trying to forbid Palestinians from speaking Arabic, or destroying Mosques or other religious sites, or taking any other action to otherwise assault the very existence of the Palestinian identity. Israel does not engage in things like this. I don't see any sign that Israel is against the existence of Palestinians as a non-Jewish ethnic population. There's also a host of facts that seem difficult to reconcile with the genocidal-intent hypothesis, including the fact there's a population of over a million Palestinians who live in Israel proper who hold citizenship and full legal rights, that Israel has been so compromising and conciliatory in the past, that the Palestinian population has been increasing over time instead of decreasing, and that even with the means to carry out any mass killing they could get away with Israel has killed ultimately only a few percent of the population in Gaza, a region totally at Israel's mercy. To account for these or any other observations that would serve as evidence against genocidal intent, the anti-Zionists have a simple, sweeping answer, which is that Israel has been engaging in a generations-long covert operation meant to slowly but surely commit genocide while having plausible deniability the entire time. In this, they delve into conspiracy thinking. They build a fortress in their mind that is carefully designed to be unfalsifiable, imperviousâ€”no matter how many times it fails, no matter how well it does or does not align with the facts.

Israel has historically been the more compromising power. The Israelis just want to exist in their current territory unperturbed and are willing to accept great costs if necessary to do so. They make concessions, they withdraw from territory, the sign treaties, they obey their agreements. However, they've been under regular attack for decadesâ€”by people who insist on their destruction, and who cannot be satisfied with peaceful coÃ«xistenceâ€”and therefore get dragged into wars, in the past by Arab states who sought to destroy them, and now by Iran-proxy terrorist groups living on their borders. When Israel does engage in military activity in these regions (Gaza and the West Bank), they drop leaflets announcing their intent ahead of time, they give civilians time to flee the area, they call and tell people where to go. As far as I'm aware Israel has historically done more than any other fighting force to try and reduce civilian deaths.

And part of why that is could be that Hamas has the opposite goal. They would throw their own people into a furnace and burn them as fuel if they thought doing so would empower them to murder more Jews. Hamas puts the civilians in Gaza in harm's way as a deterrent. They operate under schools and hospitals, they operate in urban centres. They don't bother using any of their resources to protect civilians, because they don't want to protect civilians. They view a higher civilian death toll as a tool of propaganda in the war of public opinion against Israel. The more of their own people they can get to perish, the worse Israel looks. They don't care about international law. They don't follow any of the rules of warfare. They don't care if anything they do is a war crime. They only care about destroying Israel and hold theirselves to no standards whatsoever in pursuit of that goal.

In the 2023 Israel--Hamas war, what I would say is that Israelis and Palestinians have been at conflict for so long that there's a certain level of dehumanization, callousness, and desperation among individuals of either group that results in a high risk of unjustified killing---especially by the stronger and more well-organized Israeli side, who are now especially incensed by the Oct 7 terror attacks and the harrowing experience of carrying out warfare in Gaza. This may take the form of, say, IDF soldiers not being as disciplined as they should be, being too suspicious or condemnatory of Gazans they encounter, or in some cases an immoral soldier lashing out, taking out their anger about the situation onto people in Gaza who don't deserve it. These are inferences one could make judging from past conflicts (e.g. it would be unjustified if a Jewish soldier were to kill some random Germans because they were so upset after learning about the Holocaust, but this kind of irrational killing is also not surprising during terrible conflicts).
