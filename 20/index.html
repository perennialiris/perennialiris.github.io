# Israel--Palestine

||date
2025-02-13

Israel--Palestine feels like the most divisive, polarizing issue these days. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. Are you siding with the terrorists, fascists, theocrats, antisemites, the people who target civilians and use their own people as human shields? No, wait---are you siding with the apartheid state that's trying to genocide the Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor. It feels like no matter what you say, some portion of the population will end up hating you.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. It's strained some of mine. I'm willing to take that risk over certain issues, where if somebody disagrees with me I'd prefer they know. But as this topic was so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, let alone change their minds, and was not immediately relevant to my country's politics anyway (most voters didn't care much about conflicts on the other side of the world), for years my position was that it wasn't worth getting into, so I largely avoided the conversation. And this is what many people in society did as well, until the [October 7 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks) pulled the conflict back into the spotlight and made it fashionable to have a strong opinion about.

As debate about Israel--Palestine now seems unavoidable and is in the public interest (i.e. I'm now *expected*, in a way that I wasn't a few years ago, to have a clear position about it), I've here compiled my own thoughts about every aspect of the scenario I can think of. If you want to argue with me about it, you can direct me to what part of this page you disagree with.

## Terms clarification

To make this all more accessible, let's start with some maps and definitions of key terms.

||image-box
20-6.png|A quick map of the region today
20-7.png|And a more small-scale map to show Iran and Qatar

||table
**Gaza**, or the **Gaza Strip**, or **the Gaza** | the small territory in the western corner of Israel, a densely-populated area with a few major cities (the main one, in the north, is called Gaza city, and is *sometimes* also referred to simply as Gaza---pay attention for that); many of its residents are descendents of refugees displaced from Israel in the 1940s (many others went to Jordan)
**West Bank** | the larger Palestinian territory on the **east** side of Israel, so called because it's the west bank of the [Jordan River](media/20-4.png) (image link), the natural feature that separates Israel from Jordan
**Palestine**, or the **Palestinian territories** | the combination of the West Bank and Gaza ("Palestine" historically referred to the whole area, including what is now Israel, so now it just means "the part that's not Israel")
the **Golan Heights**, or the **Golan** | the region between Israel and Syria, effectively controlled by Israel (Israel annexed it in 1981); this is considered an illegal occupation; international organizations consider it an Israeli-occupied part of Syria
**Hamas** (the Islamic Resistance Movement) | this can refer to the civil government of Gaza (since 2007), but also to its affiliated militant Islamist wing; the intended meaning varies by context, though the latter use (talking about the terrorist wing) is more common
**Hezbollah** (Party of Allah) | the militant Islamist group that operates in southern Lebanon, which has infiltrated the Lebanon government and exists as a parallel force within Lebanon
the **Houthis** | the militant Islamist group that controls western Yemen
the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (the PLO), as represented by the **Palestine Authority** (or the **Palestine National Authority**) | a national coalition meant to represent the Palestinian population (founded 1964); the official representative of Palestine at the United Nations (since 1974);---it was initially labelled a terrorist group and its stated goal was the total destruction of Israel, but it became more moderate over time; the [Oslo accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords) (1993--1995) placed the Palestinian territories under control of the **Palestine Authority**, a governing body controlled by [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah), the largest party within the PLO coalition;---the Palestine Authority still controls the West Bank to this day, but notably they *lost* control of Gaza to Hamas in 2006
**IDF** | Israeli Defense Forces (the Israeli military)
**Mossad** | common name for the Israeli national intelligence agency; the name "Mossad" comes from the Hebrew word for "institution"
**Zionism** | the movement started by Jews in late-19th century Europe to create a state in the Middle East where Jewish people could be the majority and ergo have political self-determination; the name originates from Mount Zion, a location in Jerusalem, which is considered the historical home of the Jewish people

## Why care about this topic?

To talk about Israel--Palestine in a productive manner requires we not fall into accusing one another of the worst of intentions. If somebody tells me that my opposition to Israel is rooted in hating Jews---or that my support for Israel is rooted in hating Arabs---then in either case we're no longer talking about Israel--Palestine, but having a meta-conversation about my motivation to talk about it, and they're signalling they don't respect what I have to say because of my alleged motivation. I take this as an invitation to no longer engage with that person, because I don't know why they should want to talk with me anyway if that's what they believe.

It's possible for somebody who is very critical of Israel to be motivated by antisemitism, or a bias against Jewish people. They fixate on Israel, the only Jewish country, while ignoring all other wars, conflicts, and cruelty elsewhere in the world---even just elsewhere in the Arab world. They care about international law, but only when Israel is violating it. They care about genocidal and dehumanizing rhetoric, except when it's directed against Jews. They often fall into believing conspiracy theories about Jews pulling the strings in Western governments, manipulating our foreign policy, and controlling our media. They offer endless compassion and understanding for Arabs who engage in terrorism, but none at all for innocent Jews born into Israel who've known no other life than being surrounded by enemies who want them dead.

It's also possible for somebody who's very supportive of Israel to be motivated by racism and dehumanization of Arabs or Muslims. There are people who think of the Palestinians as uncivilized, scum, animals, or savages, as people who are incapable of peace, incapable of living in modern society, and ultimately as nothing more than a nuisance, and they wouldn't mind if Israel decided to wipe them out all. They act as though all Palestinians are guilty of the actions of the terrorists. They also weaponize the fact Palestinians have an Islamic culture that is repressive of homosexuality and of women's rights, as though being born into such a culture is a crime for which the Palestinians deserve some kind of cosmic punishment.

I'm wary of either possibility, and I do what I can to combat racist or dehumanizing speech in our community. When talking to people who are more supportive of Israel, I will argue if necessary that the Palestinians are unworthy of scorn or hatred, that they're our fellow human beings and how we treat people matters---including those among them who are actually in terrorist groups, which is not the majority. As I wrote in *Politics fundamentals*, a great test of your morality is how you treat somebody who's at your mercy. I likewise try to be wary about how Jewish people are treated and spoken of, which in my case---because I tend to interact with more left-wing people than right-wing these last few years---has been the greater of these two struggles.

There are legitimate reasons for a person in the West to be very critical of Israel, and even to give it far more attention than wars or conflicts elsewhere in the world. There are numerous points of entry at which a person could become acutely aware of the topic in the first place:

* We are all likely to become *aware* of Israel because our history classes teach about World War II, the Holocaust, and the League of Nations. In this way, the founding of Israel feels related to our own history, and what happens there may even feel like our fault or our responsibility, which makes it more interesting than whatever is happening in other parts of the world that feel more distant from us.
* We could hear about it each election cycle, when some of our politicians get on stage and clarify their support for Israel. I recall that in past elections here in Canada, the Conservative Party would include their support for Israel somewhere on their party platform, as one point mixed in with everything else. I don't believe any other countries were mentioned. I understand why somebody thought to include it on that page, but if I were unfamiliar with the conflict, I'd be wondering: what gives? Why are we talking about some country seemingly so far-removed from our own affairs?
 Compare: if the people in my government were all expected to have a position on what's happening in Andorra, then I would instantly want to know more about whatever's happening down there than I do now. And then if I found out the Andorran government were doing things I find gravely immoral, I might be upset that so many people in our government want to keep sending them aid.
* The Israel--Palestine conflict has also become noteworthy because of its longevity. The conflict has been going on for so long, and is so commonly seen as intractable, that for much of my life "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline, a simile for an unrealistic goal that you don't know how to achieve. This itself can make people curious: what could be so difficult about it? Why *hasn't* the world been able to get these two groups to stop fighting and killing each other after so long?
* There's been more activism on behalf of the Palestinian cause than for either side of many other issues. We could ask why that is---but we could also step back and realize it's not any one person's fault this is the case. We can't blame somebody for being more aware of Israel--Palestine than they are of the Boko Haram insurgence in Nigeria when they grew up in an environment where their peers were talking about one more than the other.

Then, once you get into Israel--Palestine, you find there's so much material, and it branches out into so many other topics, that it can easily keep you occupied for a long time. It leads to discussion and debate about the history of the region, which is told differently depending on whom you ask; to talking about imperialism and colonialism, and what obligation we have to deal with the lingering effects of past injustice; to talking about international law, the laws of armed conflict, how that's interpreted, how it should be enforced; and even to discussing fundamental questions about the very nature of a country or a national identity---what does it mean to be Palestinian? What is a valid or invalid basis on which to found a country?

## Intuitions

Let's take a few steps back. Imagine imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine and you're approaching it for the first time, intent on forming a position. You have no bias about it. You haven't been influenced to think one way or another. You're just a normal person who doesn't hate Jews or Muslims. If you started looking into the topic today, or perhaps a few years ago before the recent war escalated, what would be your initial impression? It depends. The conflict triggers various intuitions depending on who's examining it. What sort of thoughts come to mind for you? Let's consider some possibilities.

#### 1. Choose the side that does less bad stuff.

If it's a war between two sides, then maybe we should just ask which side is morally worse. If you look at Israel and then at groups like Hamas or Hezbollah, there's a lot about each of them to lead a normal person to figure Israel is less bad---perhaps not angels, but further from devils. They have a better system of government, better laws, better culture, they do better on women's rights, gay rights, religious tolerance, freedom of speech, democracy, adherence to international norms. Who would rather side with the Islamist fascists? I'd much rather live in Tel Aviv.

#### 2. Choose the side that aligns with us.

If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and wants to be our friend and is happy to work with us, and is a generally valuable asset in our broader goals in the region, then maybe we should shrug and pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is a good ally to the West, and if we decided that wasn't important anymore, it's not like we could feasibly switch sides anyway because Israel's enemies all hate us. This, realistically, it how many people are approaching the issue (including all our politicians). "Israel wants to be our friend, and the people who they're fighting hate us, ergo Israel is the side we're on; the end."

#### 3. Favour the underdog.

With great power comes great responsibility. If one side of a conflict is far more wealthy and powerful than the other, then they're the ones who are really in control, and they have a greater responsibility to act properly and direct the conflict in a moral way. In this case, Israel is holding all the cards while the Palestinians are oppressed, so if the state of things is unacceptable, then Israel is the country we should be blaming and expecting to make a change. This is another common perspective with a broad psychological appeal.

#### 4. Favour the native population.

Some people consider Israel a country of people who are foreign to the Middle East and therefore colonizers, whereas Palestinians are the native people who were there first. This means before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same piece of land, Israel has less legitimacy, and Palestinians are in the right in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as an extension of a broader Western interest in having some levers of power in the Middle East, which could be something a person opposes. (In actuality, many Israelis are not "foreigners" at all. In the early years, there were Jewish settlers from Europe who moved to Israel, but today the majority are Jews born in Israel, many of them descended from Jewish families that fled to Israel from elsewhere in the Middle East. Nonetheless, this intuition is persuasive for some people.)

#### 5. Oppose Jewish influence.

Jewish people have long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the West, there are people whose view of Israel is they're manipulators, that they attacked the USS *Liberty*, that they had something to do with 9/11, they use their control of media companies and AIPAC to control American foreign policy, they want to drag us into wars in the Middle East for their own benefit. They side against Israel in their conflict with the Arab world because they think of Israelis as nefarious Jews whom they want nothing to do with. This is more common among right-wing people, especially conspiracy theorists, though many of their memes and arguments have infected the left as well.

#### 6. Be mindful of our prejudice.

Liberal people try to be self-aware about the danger of bias and prejudice, and compensate for that in their evaluation of things. In the Israel--Palestine conflict they may see a danger of siding with Israelis because Palestinians are poorer, they're Muslims, and they're seen as less "white" than Jews (because of how European Jews are portrayed in Western media---in actuality, many Jews look more like other Middle Eastern peoples). To counteract this prejudice hazard, Jews are placed under a higher level of scrutiny, because we're trying to self-reflect and check ourselves. So in practice, this works out in the Palestinians' favour.

#### 7. Anti-American bias.

A far-left tendency is to oppose the US exerting control around the world. They criticize everything that happens in international affairs through the lens of wanting to reduce the American sphere of influence. In the Israel--Palestine conflict, they view Israel as an extension of American interests, or as a puppet of the US, being used as a divide to destabilize the Middle East for our own purposes. Israel's very existence is therefore opposed, and the countries that want to destroy Israel (including Iran) are often favoured.

Of these, which intuition(s) do you find most appealing? When I first began trying to sort out all my thoughts about this conflict, the one that affected my thinking the most was the first example I listed: "choose the side that does less bad stuff". That's just part of how I navigate conflicts. If you were to tell me a war just broke out between two factions in any other random country on the planet and I had to take a side, I would start by asking which faction is less evil.

In applying that lens to Israel--Palestine, I made the following observations:

* Israel's government is something like a middling European democracy---flawed, but aspiring in the right direction. They have freedom of speech, they allow vocal criticism of the government, you're allowed to form opposition parties and vote the current government out of power. Their military is also held to a far higher standard than any other in the region. There are some problematic aspects of Israeli society, but in terms of its overall character, it's far less oppressive than average for this part of the world.
* The terrorist groups Israel is at war with aren't seeking freedom; they're basically fascists. They want to implement an authoritarian, theocratic society powered by radical Islam. And in their fight to destroy Israel, they have virtually no ethics, they have no respect for international law, they have no regard for civilian deaths, no, all bets are off, they're willing to do anything it takes to win. This is not a normal "resistance movement", it's a resistance movement that's been hijacked by crazy people.
* Hamas and other Islamist groups openly proclaim their goal is not ending the occupation of Palestine, but the eradication of Jews and the complete destruction of Israeli society. They say not death to Israelis, but death to the Jews---and that's not a mistake; they're well aware of the distinction. They aren't against Arab Israelis, and non-Israeli Jews don't get a pass. If they got their way, they would carry out a second Holocaust.

For me, this formed a reasonable basis for leaning toward support for Israel, but I still had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort to brutality *after decades of injustice* cancel out that initial injustice? No. If Israel is imposing unjust conditions onto the Palestinians, then any intuition about Israel seeming to operate in a more moral way in the present can't be the end of the story.

If you aren't sure what I mean, imagine a slave society where some people are owned as property. A group of rebel slaves break free and rampage through the streets. They kill whole families, they rape women, they laugh while doing it. I could say these rebels had done something immoral, and that would be true---but their actions being immoral doesn't speak to whether the conditions of slavery were justified to begin with. It would be a mistake to let that distract me from also condemning the latter, which is actually the far greater crime overall.

An immoral thing can appear better than it is when it becomes part of a system that legitimizes it through rules and procedure, and people grow used to it over time. What if the system itself is evil? What if we've grown accustomed to evil? This is what the Palestinian cause demands we investigate. Is there something abhorrent and unacceptable about the status quo, like slavery, that Palestinians are forced to endure, and which it would be wrong of us to overlook while condemning the latest Hamas attack?

## The Israeli perspective

The Jews were effectively a powerless, persecuted minority, constantly scapegoated and discriminated against, and now they were the primary targets of one of the most terrible genocides of all time. And even after having just liberated them from the Nazis, many of the most powerful Western countries didn't care about the Jews. Jewish refugees were turned away, rejected, and continued to be treated badly. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. How could they? So they came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance, to create their own space where they could be safe and have autonomy instead of being forever at the mercy of the ruling majority population of other countries. Predictably they were attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who would prefer to wipe them all out.

20-5.png|Israel, surrounded in the Arab world|Israel, surrounded in the Arab world

Today the 'underdog' mentality benefits the Palestinians, but in the past it more benefited Israel. Look at them on a map, surrounded by much larger enemies with bigger populations. And Israel didn't used to have the technological or economic advantages it has today. For decades, Israel was the underdog in the Middle East---and much of that time was during the Cold War, when the entire world was fighting over democracy versus Communism. They were on our side, the only democracy in the Middle East, while many of the Arabs associated with the Soviets. Their victories felt like our victories. That's how people who remember those years largely feel about it. They went to war against Hezbollah and Hamas, they came out ahead, then we took down the Berlin Wall, and it all blurs together in the collective memory as a time that it kicked ass to be American.

Then 9/11 happened. The public was psychologically unprepared for the trauma this would apparently inflict upon them. This firmly secured that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, the Muslims are the ones who aren't on our side, meaning the Jews are the ones who are, because the enemy of my enemy and all that. But if you were born in the late 90s or later, you might barely remember 9/11, not remember the Cold War at all, and none of this really means anything to you. For you, Israel is just some country somewhere that all your politicians weirdly feel the need to mention, and then you hear on the news that they're doing apartheid and racism and ethnic cleansing, and you're like, hey, wait, isn't this terrible? There's a significant generational difference in information and perspective.

Israelis view theirselves as being surrounded by big enemies, and having a history of fighting big enemies. They think they're the little guy. But when people in the West today look at Israel, they only compare Israel to Palestine. They look at Israeli soliders, then they look at where people in Gaza live. The frame has shifted in such a way that Israel is now viewed as the oppressor bullying the little guy. This shift happened partly because of deliberate media tactics by Israel's critics, but also due to actually changing circumstances. Which framing is more accurate?

To get a feel for things like that, we have to back at least a century or so.

## Terrorism isn't unique to any population

If the region where I live were annexed by some other country and we were occupied---or ruled over by a neighbouring state that freely entered our territory at will in a manner that was very close to if not technically an occupation---for a long period of time, and all of us opposed this and wanted it to stop but couldn't overpower this enemy through conventional means and they were unwilling to cede control to us, then my expectation is that my people would eventually become terrorists, for lack of better word. Some of them, anyway. Not all of us, not a majority, but some of us. Enough of us that it would pose a problem.

I'm not describing this as good or bad. I'm sure one could argue that the potential for some humans to do bad things has good side-effects in preventing us from being too easily ruled over. The point is only to say that in any large population, you can expect there to be a diverse range of psychologies, including people who are more willing than average to engage in what I consider terrible actions, especially when they feel their cause is righteous and desperate and rooted in self-defense against an evil enemy.

On a similar note: in Nazi Germany, who do you think guarded all the extermination camps? They didn't have to breed those Germans in a lab. They already existed among the population. If a dictatorship arose in any given country, there's going to be some percentage of people who come to support it. And if your country *doesn't* fall to dictatorship, those people would probably just carry on living normal lives, their potential for horrific action never being realized or utilized. They exist among us. Their psychotic nature requires a certain environment to activate it. I sometimes encounter people whom I think this about: "If we lived in Nazi Germany, this guy would've been fine standing guard at Dachau." Haven't you ever met anyone like that? Not that he's going to be a serial killer in this life, but that if the stars aligned and he was called to action, he'd shrug and pull the trigger.

So it's important, when judging another population, to remember that our potential to do horrific things has not gone away either. We just live in different circumstances and as such that potential is typically not unlocked. We've created peaceful, orderly societies, but we're not inherently special or better in that way. If our societies collapsed, some of us would become terrorists too. There are people in Gaza today who were born there while it was occupied by Israel, and then people who were born after Israel stopped occupying it directly, but while it's still under blockade with a militarized border and periodic visits by Israeli militants. And they grow up listening to stories from their elders about how this all came to be. In the West Bank, people are born into a circumstance where they're relatively poor and unsafe, but soldiers from a more powerful country to the west of them occasionally come in and act like they run the place. For most of us in the West, we can only imagine what this feels like. And this is the only world they've ever known.

Then, down the street, there's a man who offers them a chance to join the fight, to actually do something and strike back against the source of all their problems. *Of course* many of them are interested. And if we agreed with their cause, we would characterize this as the more heroic path, at least at first.

This is where some people don't agree when I say Hamas does more immoral things than Israel. They view Israel's very existence, or the existence of the blockade, or Israel's military occupation in the West Bank, to be evil (which thing they focus on depends in the person). Hamas is like the rebel slave, reacting to Israeli oppression. The observation that Hamas does wicked things as part of their fight doesn't speak to whether Israel's actions are justified to begin with. This is why you can't avoid getting into the history of everything.

Be careful not to fall too hard in the other direction either, though. Just because you're a victim doesn't mean you can't also be a villain. Maybe that guy who beats his wife was bullied as a child. Everybody has a story for why they are the way they are. We can't act like people have no responsibility for their actions just because something bad happened to them. The Nazis had a story of how they had been pushed around and beaten on, too. Feeling like you're the underdog and ergo you have license to break the rules and pursue vengeance can be a powerful tool in service of evil.

How did we get here? First, I want to ask: how did it come to be that a majority of people in the West support Israel, anyway? Let's consider the early Israeli narrative, and the history that led up to Israel's founding.

## The history of the conflict

Even before Nazi Germany, Jews were mistreated in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904), a Jewish man born in what is today Hungary, founded modern Zionism by proposing that Jews should unite and form a state of their own because they could never truly feel secure as a minority in Christian Europe, where Jews were forever considered aliens and outsiders, used as scapegoats, and occasionally they were massacred in pogroms that destroyed their communities. The case for Herzl's proposal would only become stronger in the decades after his death.

||image-float
20-1.png|The Ottoman Empire in 1914 (modern borders faded)

As a consequence of the events of **World War I** (1914--1918), the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled a large part of the Middle East from its capital in Constantinople, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides of the war, and Britain sought to destabilize them by supporting Arab revolts against Ottoman rule. The following year, with WWI still ongoing, Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary and former Prime Minister, declared that after the war, Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in a region called Palestine, then under Ottoman rule, where there was already a Jewish population. His letter of support is now known as the **Balfour declaration**. It was deliberately vague, not defining its terms or specifying any exact location or boundaries.

A year before the Balfour declaration, Britain also made promises to Arab leaders to recognize Arab independence after the war---though like the Balfour declaration, their promises weren't very specific. This traces back to a series of communications in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahonâ€“Hussein correspondence**, between British diplomat Henry McMahon and Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi (1854--1931), the Sharif of Mecca who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. A proponent of pan-Arabism, Hussein declared himself Caliph after the war, but detested the Balfour declaration and refused to coÃ¶perate with the British (e.g. he refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles). This eventually led to the British supporting Ibn Saud, who in 1925 conquered Hejaz and took Mecca, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia.

||image-float
20-8.png|The Sykes--Picot Agreement

Britain also made a secret agreement with France in 1916 called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement** to partition their control of Ottoman territory in the Levant after the war, with Britain taking the southern part and France the north. Palestine was on the western end of the British side of the partition, ergo it was the British whom Jews had to work with and appeal to. The UN later (in 1920) explicitly gave Britain a mandate to control this territory until it could become self-governing, and it ergo became known as **Mandatory Palestine** while under British control.

The Ottomans defeated in WWI, Allied forces occupied Constantinople, and so began the **Turkish War of Independence**, where Turkish Nationalists, led by AtatÃ¼rk, fought to repel the Allies from the country, formally end the Ottoman Empire (1922) and establish the modern republic of Turkey (1923). I mention this to further emphasize how much the world was changing in this period. Countries were rising and falling, borders being redrawn, and in the background, millions of normal people were picking up their lives and migrating to avoid conflict. In the interwar period (1918--39), tens of thousands Jewish people continued migrating to the region, settling new towns, developing farmland, but also leading to conflict and tension with the Arab population in that area. The British even limited how many Jews were allowed to migrate to the region because they noticed it was leading to problems, and it was still their responsibility to keep the peace. Though some Jewish people had always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to them at this time was exacerbated by the perception they were Europeans, foreigners coming into the region from abroad---an ironic fate for the Jews, considered aliens both in Europe and in the Levant, apparently homeless no matter where they want. (In the following decades, many Jews throughout the rest of the Middle East would flee persecution to Israel, and so Israel became less 'European' the more time went by.)

||image-float
20-2.png|A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region---not carelessly in half, but with respect to the existing population and its demography while trying to create a Jewish-majority region per the wishes of the Zionist movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would end up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' would've been only barely majority-Jewish. In other words, they put as many Muslims as possible into the Jewish side without going over half, then gave the rest to Muslims as well. On the other hand, this resulted in the Jewish side having more land per person.

Arabs viewed the partition plan as unfairly benefitting the Jews, boycotted participation in the negotiations, and refused to accept any partition plan proposed. The UN passed the resolution anyway, and British forces began withdrawing from the region. In 1948, just as the British Mandate ended, Israelis declared independence, fighting broke out, and both sides prepared for war. Troops from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Jordan attacked, but Israel fought back and held its own, leading to a stalemate in 1949 and these countries all signing an armistice agreement, which became the de facto borders of Israel for the next few decades.

In the aftermath, around 700,000 Arabs fled for their safety or were directly expelled, as hundreds of Palestinian villages were looted and destroyed. For Israelis, it was a victory. They had to fight for it, and they didn't get everything they wanted, but they finally had a territory to call their own, and it was even in their historic homeland. For Palestinians, the resolution of this conflict became known as **the Nakba**, an act of violent dispossession that left many of them as refugees and gave shape to the Palestinian identity.

### How many people were displaced?

If you look it up on Wikipedia, the estimate given is 750,000. That's the size of a reasonably large city today. It's roughly the same population as Seattle. If some kind of political crisis happened that resulted in the United States forcibly removing everybody from Seattle, that would presumably be quite the tragedy and everybody would pay attention. Hurricane Katrina displaced about 1,000,000 million people from their homes. And in the case of Palestine, it wasn't just one city, but hundreds of small towns and villages throughout the region. And unlike after a hurricane, they weren't allowed to come back afterwards.

This type of forced relocation is viewed far more negatively in hindsight than it was back then. Today it seems people wouldn't even *consider* displacing a million people as part of a solution to some kind of conflict. But for much of history, the notion that a group of people is intimately or spiritually connected with any given area they happen to inhabit, and could never be forced to abandon that, was not present in most circumstances. The native populations of some place were often seen more as obstacles that we sometimes had to pick up and move around in order to secure some broader geopolitical goal. They'd get over it and settle elsewhere. This was happening in Asia, as the India--Pakistan partition took place. It was happening elsewhere in the Middle East. Even after World War II, there were massive population transfer in Europe that remade the continent, as borders shifted and Germans were expelled from central and eastern Europe. In the context of the world as it was in 1947, the expulsion of Arabs from much of Israel was not seen as a uniquely immoral event, much less a completely intolerable one. The Arab side refused to accept an international plan, they attacked, they lost, and now they're getting kicked out by the side who won. The notion that Israel is to this day not a legitimate state or a state which "has no right to exist" based on this initial action of expulsion is unrealistic, unpersuasive, and obviously not applied consistently.

Had it been a particularly noteworthy location---like an historical city like Constantinople, or a place of great religious importance like Mecca---then different considerations would likely have been made. But Palestine was more seen as some random plot of land, a name given to a sparsely populated rectangle on the outskirts of an empire that was no more. Its population was not seen as a distinct or special population with their own unique history or identity. They were just considered Arabs who could easily be moved around, and there were numerous other Arab countries they could go to. Forcing them to move was therefore not treated like a monumental travesty. It was more just part of the negotiation, a cost of doing business, all part of the process of trying to end up with borders that worked reasonably well for everybody once the dust settled.

There were many Palestinians who did simply leave, millions of them ending up in Jordan (another country that had emerged out of the Ottoman dissolution), where they settled and became a major part of the Jordanian population. This caused trouble in Jordan, though, where in 1951, Palestinians murdered the first King of Jordan, Abdullah, in response to fears that he may sign a peace treaty with Israel. To this day, the Palestinian population is unfortunately viewed negatively in the rest of the Arab world, not wanted in either Jordan or Egypt due to their propensity for violence and extremism. Whenever we hear about Israel blockading the Gaza strip, remember that Egypt was blockading them too.

### Why does the conflict persist to this day?

This is a question I remember having when I was first learning about the Israel--Palestine conflict. Imagine we *did* forcibly remove everybody from Seattle. That would understandably upset people, but would their grandchildren still be going on about it 80 years later? How haven't people built new lives and moved past this by now? The people who were kicked out in 1947 aren't even alive anymore. The Israeli leadership who kicked them out aren't alive anymore. Is this not a thing of the past by now? We should be able to acknowledge that Israel is a country whose founding involved expelling people from territory, an action that would be unacceptable today. But so many other country's histories also contain bad things. American Indians aren't resorting to terrorism and attacking the United States demanding to get their whole continent back. What keeps this particular fire burning?

The problem is this conflict was always put on hold and delayed just long enough for somebody to fire another shot and start things up again. This has been primarily the 'fault' of the Arab side, who have refused, for decades, to accept compromise that involved Israel existing in any form. The initial crime of Israel expelling people from its territory apparently could not be forgiven, and being vocally anti-Zionist was a way to become popular in the Arab world. They would proclaim their commitment to the destruction of Israel, and by the 1970s Israel had become the main representative of a perceived alliance between Jews and Christians in a global war against Islam or the Islamic world. But even before that, things had quickly stopped being about Israel and Zionism and became about Jews as a people. They talked so badly about Jewish people they might have felt at home in Nazi Germany. Their express goals weren't restitution for the families that were expelled from the region; it was the destruction of the entirety of Israel and the murder of all Jewish people therewithin, from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea. This isn't hyperbole---they proclaimed it explicitly.

In some sense, on some level, the reason the conflict still persists is the fact Israel is a Jewish rather than Muslim country. Why did all the Arab countries oppose the formation of Israel to begin with? Why did they reject the partition plan? Why have they rejected every attempt at compromise or partition since then? From the beginning, they hated the idea of Jewish people having political agency in a country where they get to be the majority instead of being ruled over by Muslims. This is also why the Muslim population opposes political autonomy for Christians, Zoroastrians, Yizidis, or any other non-Muslim religious group in the Middle East, while Islam itself is divided violently along the lines of its major sects (Sunni and Shia). In this part of the world, religion dominates everything, and Muslims want everything to be dominated by Islam. They would be happy to live under another caliphate. The founding of Israel was offensive to them because it wasn't Muslim. They escalated the conflict into war because Israel wasn't Muslim. And the conflict has been prolonged to this day because Jews aren't Muslims. For the Arabs outside of Palestine, in other Arab states, the fact Israel has mistreated a small number of Muslims by kicking them out of Palestine isn't a tragedy. It's a happy coincidence. It plays into their narrative and gives them something to use against Israel over, and over, and over again.

The Arab world has a vast amount of resources at their disposal. They could help the Palestinians. They don't. They could also take in the entire population of Gaza and the West Bank to their own countries, if they had to, but they won't do that either. The reality is they don't care that much about these people. For decades, the reason the Israel--Palestine conflict has continued and couldn't be resolved was because the Palestinian population had become a pawn in the game being played by Arab leaders. They were used as a bludgeon against Israel, a thorn in Israel's side. The Arab leadership didn't *want* the problem to be solved, nor did they want people to be able to move on, so much as they wanted to destroy Israel, and they would prolong the suffering of the Palestinian people if they thought it could help them accomplish that, just as Hamas does today. The Palestinian population was meanwhile sold the lie that the rest of the Arab world stood with them, and that if they just keep fighting---fight, fight, fight, always keep fighting---eventually they would win and take it all. Where has that got them?

And when I say the Arab side, in the past this would mean all the Arab countries. Today, a special emphasis should be placed on Iran. Iran is the country that funds Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah, and other terrorist groups you've probably never heard of. They do this because they don't want the Israel--Palestine conflict to be solved (except by the destruction of Israel), and they prefer instability and conflict in the region.

## Interpreting the present

### Is Palestinian an ethnicity?

What even *is* a Palestinian? In the simplest sense, it's a person who lived in that region. There's debate about the extent to which it was even a thing before the 1940s, though. I'm currently given to believe that if you went back in time, the people who lived there before the 1920s wouldn't have identified as 'Palestinians'. They were Muslim Arabs whose leaders swore loyalty to the Ottomans. There was no particular stress or distinction placed on this location in the way that nationality or ethnicity typically implies.

20-3.png|Here's a map of where I mean

I started thinking about my own country for comparison. Imagine if a political crisis resulted in the political isolation of a chunk of Ontario that wasn't our capital or major urban centres. Let's say that stretch of land north of Lake Huron, from Sault Ste. Marie to Sudbury. Imagine the United States annexed this region, put it under military rule, built a big fence around it, every so often going in to police the region to keep dissidents under control. Would the people in this area henceforth constitute an ethnicitiy? It isn't currently, and it would come across as strange if you today spoke of "the proud Sudburian ethnic group" or something like that. It's just a place in Ontario. There are people there, and some families have been there for generations, and you might meet somebody elsewhere in the country who says they're *from* Sudbury, but nobody talks about this place as though it's a distinct nation or ethnic group. It's by and large the same people and culture you'd find elsewhere in Canada.

However, if this imaginary annexation and subjugation of the territory were to happen, it's possible an ethnic identity would emerge. Though it's often used as though a synonym for genetic identity or racial group, in sociology an ethnicity is any group of people who perceive theirselves as distinct from those not in their group based on any perceived attributes. In theory, it can be a difference in language, culture, history, religion. It doesn't need to be racial. Having a shared experience can be the thing that constitutes an ethnogenesis, meaning the creation of a new ethnic identity. Russians and Ukrainians are not significantly genetically different, but today are different ethnicities due to their history diverging and resulting in linguistic and cultural differences. So even if at some point everybody in the Middle East were just ambiguously Arabs, but then one subset of Arabs were thrown out of their homes and forced to be refugees due to a conflict with Israel, that shared experience, hardship, and trauma can lead to those people forming a shared identity. And this isn't any less 'real' than other identities just because it's one that has emerged more recently in world history.

However, the only reason this matters is because the notion that "Palestinian" is a national identity or ethnic group makes the act of expelling them from their ancestral home of Palestine sound like an even worse action than it would've been otherwise---but again, the impression I get is that it wasn't really a distinct identity *at the time*. They were simply Arabs, not significantly different from the Arabs in all the surrounding territories. The distinction with which we speak of them today formed after, and in response to, Israel's national independence. If we're giving special attention to land claims that accompany distinct identities, our condemnation about that should not apply *ex post facto* to a case where the expulsion is the reason the identity is even there.

But to give the question a simple yes or no: yes, today I consider Palestinian an ethnicity for all intents and purposes. It may be an ethnicity that formed most concretely in the 20th century, but it has effectively existed now for a few generations, if not longer.

### Is Israel committing genocide?

The term *genocide* has important legal and political implications, which is why politicians will often avoid it, even if they're critical of what Israel is doing. The moment they utter it, they would triggering a different type of conversation. The rest of us are not so burdened, however, and in conversation "genocide" is used far more loosely, as though a general term for a mass killing, for which the non-genocide term is often "massacre". And it's not new for people to have disagreements about how to most accurately label mass killing events. Near the end of the Bosnian war, for example, Serbian forces killed around 8,000 Bosniaks in what some people call a genocide, but other people only refer to as a massacre. Noam Chomsky was one of these people, which is why some people called him a genocide denier---which isn't accurate, since he wasn't denying any of it happened; he only disagreed about what to call it.

For most people, though, "what is a genocide?" is an uninteresting question because it's not something they feel needs to be defined strictly or used carefully. It's about the spirit of the word and perhaps the quantity of people dying. Is Israel killing a lot of Palestinians? Yes? Then it's a genocide of Palestinians. That's the level on which we're often operating. Nor would people who feel strongly about the matter care to argue about the grey area. They would not change their mind about the conflict if it were somehow found that Israel's actions are similar to genocide but *technically* not. It would still be close enough, and you would likely be judged for bothering to quibble about where exactly the line is drawn.

The frequent counter-point is to ask: was World War II a genocide? We killed a lot of Germans. Was dropping nuclear bombs on Japan a genocide? There *are* people who answer yes, which is interesting; but the point is these actions weren't traditionally considered genocidal, despite being mass death events. A differentiator might be that Japan and Germany were military threats to us, which therefore made killing their people justified, if unfortunate. We could then say a genocide is not simply a mass killing, but an *unjustified* mass killing. But is Israel not under military threat? Do they not have justification to fight enemies that want to fight them? In this way the conversation moves to whether Israel is justified in what it's doing---or, perhaps, just *how much* of what it's doing could be justified. (It's noteworthy here that the genocide case against Israel among international organizations in Europe concedes that Israel is taking justified military action against Hamas, but asserts that Israel is *also* going above and beyond that, to do unjustified destruction to the population that may be characterized as genocidal.)

In comparison with the WWII examples, the focus is often the military--technological power disparity between the two sides. Hamas is probably not an existential threat in the same way that Nazi Germany was and retaliation against them is thus perceived as less justified, like an adult punching a child in the face because the child punched first. That framing would be upsetting for Israelis whose families were killed by the 'child' in question, but is still how many anti-Zionists perceive the conflict in the big picture.

In practice, many conversations don't reach that point. "Genocide" is often invoked because the speaker wants to wield the rhetorical power that it provides. This is useful for clarifying their own attitude about the situation, but effectively restricts the potential for dialogue. If an action is genocidal, then you can't be in favour of it, you can't make excuses for it, you can't even fail to properly condemn it---otherwise you're a genocide apologist (or something similar), and you can be dismissed, condemned, and your words ignored. In other words, once we've agreed to use the term "genocide", there is an an impenetrable veil of moral superiority that allows its user to put their brain on standby and not meaningfully engage with you any further. If Israel is doing genocide, then Israel is in the wrong, and that's the end of the conversation. It becomes black and white, simple, morally uncomplicated. And if all the facts were on their side, perhaps that rigid attitude would be justified. We don't have patience for somebody who seeks to minimize the Holocaust, for example---but that's because the dust has long settled, everything has been studied thoroughly, and it's such a clear-cut case that our choice of language to describe it is as unambiguous as could be.

For this reason, the question of whether Israel is committing "genocide" is sometimes a hill that people decide is worth dying on. To them this language becomes essential because if they can maintain it, they control and automatically "win" any conversation they enter. They'll begin an interaction by asking whether you consider the conflict a genocide. If you don't, they refuse to go any further until that's resolved. If you do, then the bulk of their work is done and what comes after that point is barely of any importance. At the end of the day you're either against the genocide (you agree with them) or you're not (you're evil and can be dismissed).

A more expansive sense of genocide has always been that it doesn't need to apply to a *genetic* group (as the word may seem to imply, coming from *gÃ©nos* + *-cide*, meaning race or tribe death), but to any discernible social identity. (On a related note, in anthropology an 'ethnicity' is not strictly a genetic cluster, despite that being the implied meaning for which the term is often used.) I often talk about people not as being consciously pro-genocide but as having a genocidal mindset. This is when a person says, essentially, "You know what? Fuck this other group of people. I just want them gone, I want them to disappear, so the world doesn't have to deal with their kind anymore."

Let's say the group in question were Buddhists and the mechanism of accomplishing this disappearance were to outlaw all aspects of Buddhist culture---destroy their temples, burn their books, take out their leaders or otherwise unifying voices---to a point where 'Buddhist' as an identifiable social class has disappeared from society. At the very least, one should consider this very similar to genocide, as if Buddhists *were* a genetic group, then the perpetrators of this attack may well have ended their genetic lineage instead, since the goal was the group's elimination. It only wasn't necessary here because they could make the group disappear through other means.

The term **cultural genocide** is used for when a society doesn't kill or sterilize every member of a certain group (thus ending their genetic lineage), but forcibly eliminates the social markers associated with a group's identity through forced assimilation or cultural repression---allowing the individuals to live, but still getting rid of the group from society. This is like the difference between removing a building through demolition and removing it by careful disassembly of every screw, beam, and panel, allowing us to recover and repurpose each one as a building material. Either way, the end result is the building is gone.

This is the sense in which it may be more appropriate to speak of a "transgender genocide"---not meaning the mass murder of trans people, but the creation of social rules, in society where trans people exist socially, that would effectively eliminate trans people as a social class. This could mean outlawing medical transition, outlawing crossdressing, reversing any gender changes issued for state identification, and restricting discourse or literature about the topic, perhaps labelling it subversive propaganda that's harmful to children. In short, it would mean forcing trans people to conform with their birth sex, making it impossible for them to *be* transgender any longer. This is the ultimate goal of people who possess a *genocidal mindset* toward the transgender population, i.e. they simply want trans people as a group to disappear and never be seen or heard from again. This is what was being expressed by the right-wing propagandist Michael Knowles when he got on stage at CPAC in 2023 and declared that he wanted to "eradicate transgenderism from society". If trans people *were* a genetic group, like Jews, Armenians, or Romani, and it were therefore possible to eliminate the group forever by getting rid of all current members, then that may be the route some people consider.

There's a difference between wanting to eliminate a group and wanting reform or change within the population in question. If somebody believes there's a problem with Romani people in their city, which is that they're prone to criminal behaviour like pickpocketing in busy tourist areas (a common trope about Romani migrants), they could make it their goal to do something about that, to help change the behaviour of the people in question, to figure out how to lower the crime rate in that community. That's more the level some people are at when it comes to gay or transgender people, or other communities as well. Criticism of a group---believing they have problems---isn't what I would describe as a genocidal mindset. A genocidal mindset is when you just want to get rid of them, not improve their situation. It can be crucial to not mix this up.

The question I've been leading up to is this: does Israel have a genocidal intent? There are people who believe a conscious and longstanding goal of Israel as a state is to eliminate the Palestinian population. They view all of Israel's actions through this lens. I'm sure that some Israelis who have come to hate the Palestinians and would like it if they could all be eliminated so Israel doesn't have to deal with them anymore. I'm equally if not more sure there are Palestinians who feel the same way about Jews. In both countries there are people born and raised into this conflict, who have lost family to the other side, who have been subjected to propaganda meant to frighten them of and dehumanize the other. However, I wouldn't assume that most people feel this way in either territory, nor does it seem to be the controlling perspective within Israel. That is, it doesn't seem as though the Israeli state or military is operating in pursuit of Palestinians as a group no longer existing. Nor do I see how any of the history or events up until this point could fairly be interpreted that way.

There can be signs of genocidal intent. The repression of identity and culture, the destruction of sites of religious or historical significance, the disruption of family ties, assimilation or otherwise repression of identity of children, restricting the use or teaching of other languages. Think of the way native peoples in North America were treated in the past, forcing their children away from the parents and then assimilating them into European society. Alternatively, look at the Russia--Ukraine war today, where it's been claimed (at the ICJ) that Russia is engaging in genocidal acts against the Ukrainian people (while falsely accusing Ukraine of genocide). Not only have tens of thousands died as a result of Russia's assault on their country, but we've heard Russian leaders denying that Ukrainians are even a real or distinct population, they've banned the Ukrainian language in areas they control, they've abducted Ukrainian children from their families and brought them back to Russia to be raised as Russians. This type of action is very alarming and speaks to the character of those making decisions in the conflict.

I would likewise be wholly condemnatory if there were any sign of Israeli forces trying to forbid Palestinians from speaking Arabic, or destroying Mosques or other religious sites, or taking any other action to otherwise assault the very existence of the Palestinian identity. Israel does not engage in things like this. I don't see any sign that Israel is against the existence of Palestinians as a non-Jewish ethnic population. There's also a host of facts that seem difficult to reconcile with the genocidal-intent hypothesis, including the fact there's a population of over a million Palestinians who live in Israel proper who hold citizenship and full legal rights, that Israel has been so compromising and conciliatory in the past, that the Palestinian population has been increasing over time instead of decreasing, and that even with the means to carry out any mass killing they could get away with Israel has killed ultimately only a few percent of the population in Gaza, a region totally at Israel's mercy. To account for these or any other observations that would serve as evidence against genocidal intent, the anti-Zionists have a simple, sweeping answer, which is that Israel has been engaging in a generations-long covert operation meant to slowly but surely commit genocide while having plausible deniability the entire time. In this, they delve into conspiracy thinking. They build a fortress in their mind that is carefully designed to be unfalsifiable, imperviousâ€”no matter how many times it fails, no matter how well it does or does not align with the facts.

Israel has historically been the more compromising power. The Israelis just want to exist in their current territory unperturbed and are willing to accept great costs if necessary to do so. They make concessions, they withdraw from territory, the sign treaties, they obey their agreements. However, they've been under regular attack for decadesâ€”by people who insist on their destruction, and who cannot be satisfied with peaceful coÃ«xistenceâ€”and therefore get dragged into wars, in the past by Arab states who sought to destroy them, and now by Iran-proxy terrorist groups living on their borders. When Israel does engage in military activity in these regions (Gaza and the West Bank), they drop leaflets announcing their intent ahead of time, they give civilians time to flee the area, they call and tell people where to go. As far as I'm aware Israel has historically done more than any other fighting force to try and reduce civilian deaths.

And part of why that is could be that Hamas has the opposite goal. They would throw their own people into a furnace and burn them as fuel if they thought doing so would empower them to murder more Jews. Hamas puts the civilians in Gaza in harm's way as a deterrent. They operate under schools and hospitals, they operate in urban centres. They don't bother using any of their resources to protect civilians, because they don't want to protect civilians. They view a higher civilian death toll as a tool of propaganda in the war of public opinion against Israel. The more of their own people they can get to perish, the worse Israel looks. They don't care about international law. They don't follow any of the rules of warfare. They don't care if anything they do is a war crime. They only care about destroying Israel and hold theirselves to no standards whatsoever in pursuit of that goal.

In the 2023 Israel--Hamas war, what I would say is that Israelis and Palestinians have been at conflict for so long that there's a certain level of dehumanization, callousness, and desperation among individuals of either group that results in a high risk of unjustified killing---especially by the stronger and more well-organized Israeli side, who are now especially incensed by the Oct 7 terror attacks and the harrowing experience of carrying out warfare in Gaza. This may take the form of, say, IDF soldiers not being as disciplined as they should be, being too suspicious or condemnatory of Gazans they encounter, or in some cases an immoral soldier lashing out, taking out their anger about the situation onto people in Gaza who don't deserve it. These are inferences one could make judging from past conflicts (e.g. it would be unjustified if a Jewish soldier were to kill some random Germans because they were so upset after learning about the Holocaust, but this kind of irrational killing is also not surprising during terrible conflicts).

### Is Israel engaging in ethnic cleansing?

They might be, sort of. It depends what we mean by that. The term ethnic cleansing is more wiggly than some of these other terms. I'm not even sure what major examples come to mind for most people if you asked them for examples of ethnic cleansing in history. The Armenians from Turkey? The Indians in early America?

I think the problem with calling it ethnic cleansing is that they have people of the same ethnicity in their country whom they're not trying to get rid of. So is it a campaign against an ethnicity?

Imagine if in Turkey, there were Armenians all throughout the country, but then in one part of Turkey, there was a province with an Armenian majority that was effectively ruled over by gangs or paramilitary groups, and they were opposing the government, and then a conflict occurred because of that. If they said "right, we're going to kick out every Armenian person from Turkey", then I guess that's "ethnic cleansing", because they're removing an ethnicity from the region. But what if they said "right, we're going to kick out all the people from this one province", and Armenians in other places were left alone? How does that work? Would we call that an ethnic cleansing? What if we also kicked out all the non-Armenians too, and it just happened to be an Armenian-majority region, and Armenians elsewhere in the country were left alone? By that point, "ethnic cleansing" is clearly not appropriate. And that's more like what's happening in Israel, in the worst case scenario, if Israel decided to push every single person out of Gaza. And they're not even doing that.

Why isn't it just considered a political conflict?

I just had a thought: if the United States deports a bunch of illegal immigrants, is that ethnic cleansing because if they're all Mexicans? Even though that's not the criteria that's used to determine whether a person gets deported or not? When you're in the magical land of "intentions don't matter", all these categories become difficult to work with.

### Is Israel an apartheid state?

The term 'apartheid' comes from South Africa. It meant "apartness" or something. It described how that country was strictly racially segregated. It was basically a race-based caste system. Whether you were black, white, Indian, or something else, would determine where you were allowed to live, what kind of jobs you could have, what schools you or your child could go to. There is nothing remotely like this in Israel. There is no segregation in Israel. There is no race-based anything in Israel. There's really nothing about the application of this term that makes any sense here. I discredit anybody who casually repeats that Israel is an apartheid state, as though what they're repeating is some kind of obvious conventional wisdom, and not a view that one *could* argue in favour of, but for which you'd need to actually make the argument. Apartheid was a fairly unique situation. The only society that's comparable is the United States during the era of Jim Crow laws, which were some regional or state-level laws in 20th century America that enforced race-based segregation of public institutions from schools to restaurants to public washrooms and drinking fountains.

<!-- "huh-guy a'lawd of bet-seh'lem" -->

There were some articles a few years ago where an Israeli human rights organization called B'Tselem was declaring that Israel is an apartheid state because they treat citizens differently from non-citizens---like every other country. How did this get taken seriously? Hagai El-Ad, the group's director, published an article in The Guardian titled "We are Israel's largest human rights group and we are calling this apartheid". The fact this organization is located in Israel makes their opinions appear very significant to people in the West, even though there's a huge diversity of opinion within Israel, a country with liberal free speech laws where you're allowed to criticize and protest the government all day if you want to. The contents of the article are a mix of conjecture, fact, and feeling. He says everything about Israel follows from an organizing principle of supremacy of Jews over Palestinians and repeats "this is apartheid". Even though he acknowledges it has none of the features of apartheid, he twists himself into using this word anyway by calling it "our version" and "apartheid 2.0". If he's acknowledging that Palestinians who aren't citizens can't vote, but the Palestinians who are citizens can, then how is anybody supposed to conclude this is anything like apartheid? It's evident just from the text of this article that it's not a race-based domination. There is no fixed racial caste. Were there black people in South Africa who had full rights as long as they were citizens? What are we talking about, and how stupid can this guy think the public is?

It could be true that if I went to Israel, I'd get the feeling that people around me do kind of think they're better than Palestinians. That's the case in many countries around the world, about groups they're at conflict with. This isn't even worth trying to dispute, because it's not a crime. And if I were in Palestine, I could imagine also getting the feeling that people around me don't like Jews very much.

There's something curious happening when it's being called apartheid 2.0, or "a modern form of" apartheid---a sentiment not unique to this article. It's apartheid, people say, but not like South African apartheid (i.e. the main, or only, version that we know, once again raising the question of why we're using this word if it's not like the only thing the word refers to?). It's a new, different kind of apartheid---apartheid for the 21st century. This is very effective rhetoric because it's tricky to disprove, as pointing out how different they are suddenly doesn't matter, or doesn't register as a refutation. "Of course they're different---that's why it's called 2.0. You wouldn't expect Toy Story 2 to be the exact same as Toy Story 1, would you?" But then what's the throughline here? Can I just say anything is the 2.0 version of some other thing? How do we justify that being so in the first place? There has to be some kind of relevant connection that we agree is the essential or defining quality of the first thing, which carries on into the second. I'll consider two examples.

* **Slavery.** In the past, slavery often took the form of *de jure* property ownership of another person. You are my slave, I own you, you are my property, the same way that my car and my bed are my mine, and the systems in our society will verify and enforce that. Today, that's generally not how it works, but we still call it slavery, though we perhaps make a distinction by calling it *modern* slavery---human trafficking, forced labour, people being physically threatened if they leave or refuse to work. There is no longer a *de jure* property claim as in chattel slavery, but the person is effectively controlled, exploited, not allowed to leave. We call it slavery despite how it differs from previous forms of slavery because the goal is the same, the mechanism is similar and accomplishes the same, and it seems like people only resort to modern slavery because more direct, historical forms of slavery aren't legal anymore. There's a thoughline in terms of intent and the effect it has on its victims.
* **Neo-Nazism.** The term neo-Nazi can lead us to similar issues at times. The criteria fro calling somebody a Nazi used to be simple: they supported Nazi Germany, or Nazi ideology (culminating in support for a dictatorship and for the extermination of people they deem inferior). What makes a person a *neo*-Nazi? Is it what symbols they use? The 'neo-' prefix adds ambiguity in a strictly semantic sense, but it refers to the real evolution of Nazi ideas that can be traced through different generations of Nazi thinkers and organizations influencing one another generationally. It's not just another, different set of views that existed or formed independently but came to similar conclusions. It's the result of the original Nazi ideology being gradually updated, adapting to how the world has changed. They make some different arguments, but there's an undercurrent of thought and attitude that connects them, as well as a line of influence that can be traced as the torch was passed down. (They also make it easy for us by reÃ¼sing Nazi symbols and in some cases plaining calling theirselves Nazis, without much regard for the distinction---but not always.)

So it's not invalid to say that one thing is the 'new version' of something else. When I say Israel isn't an apartheid state, it's not just because I'm grasping for straws and dismissing it for having some different surface-level features (like saying "this can't be slavery, because they aren't doing farm labour"). It's because there needs to be some kind of core, essential, or underlying theme, attitude, idea, or a continuity of relations or influence, in order for us to connect a line from one thing to another.

The stronger case for there being an overlap in function or effect is not about Israel proper but the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. If your position is that Israel's actions in the West Bank are unjustified in some way, that could be a reasonable position, as I'll explain later. But why is Israel in the West Bank? It's not because there's a race-based caste system they're trying to impose. It's not because they're trying to attack people for being Muslims. Israel has sought good relations with other countries whose populations are more or less identical in genetics and religious belief. The Israeli presence in the West Bank is a military occupation that arose out of conflicts about borders and national defense. We could sure find things to compare it with in history, but it wouldn't be South Africa.

Military occupation is an unspecific term for when a region is taken over by a military that's not its own. For example, during World War II, some parts of Germany were put under military occupation by Allied forces. Did they have to let the Germans in those towns vote in American elections while the military was there? If not, does that mean those Germans lived under apartheid?

What about the idea that citizenship is based on race? It would be quite the trick if South Africa were to only grant citizenship to white people and then claim they're not enforcing racial barriers, but giving a normal amount of privilege to citizens. But there is no racial boundary in citizenship. Nor is there a religious one. There are Muslim, Palestinian Arabs who are Israeli citizens. They vote in Israeli elections. The stars are not aligning here.

It is true that it's easier for people with Jewish ancestry to become citizens. There's also many other countries who extend this courtesy to their own diaspora throughout the world. Jewish people fled and spread out across other countries because they were a powerless, persecuted minority group. Now that there's finally a country where Jews have a stable population, is the idea that they're not allowed to offer their own people easier citizenship if they come home, otherwise that's a horrific system of racial domination? And yes, this isn't a unique policy. I don't think the fact it's easier for people with Irish ancestry to get Irish citizenship means Ireland is an apartheid state either.

The less-obvious downside of having this conversation is the other, potential conversations that we could've been having instead. We should be talking about the military occupation of the West Bank for what it is. We think of a military occupation as something that can be justified temporarily in war, not as something that becomes a new state of affairs and goes on for another 50 years. Would it be acceptable if the US were still ruling over parts of Germany today? Perhaps if the territory were not merely occupied but annexed and taken over, made part of their country. But in that case, Israel *would* need to accept responsibility for the people of the West Bank. We should expect they be given Israeli citizenship and all rights that accompany it. But that's not what Israel is doing or interested in doing. It's not an annexation. They aren't declaring that the West Bank is part of Israel. And this sort of **strategic ambiguity** should be the focus of criticism.

### Indiscriminate bombing and 'dumb bombs'

To kill *indiscriminately* means to not care who you're hurting, to make no distinction between your target and a casualty---like Hamas and other Islamist organizations engage in all the time. To say any modern military is killing indiscriminately is a very serious accusation, but some people throw this word around without much care.

To say that Israel is indiscriminately killing Palestinians would imply that Israeli forces are shooting or bombing any random Palestinian they see, without regard for who they are (except, presumably, that they're Palestinians and not Jews). If this were to happen at any point in time, it would deserve nothing less than fierce condemnation. However, at time of writing I haven't been made aware of any clear evidence this is happening. Israel clearly does care about target selection. They don't just kill whoever they see. They do try to target militants.

I don't know how so many people started repeating that Israel is "indiscriminately bombing" Palestinians. Perhaps they heard or saw it written somewhere and began repeating it without thinking about what it really means. "Indiscriminate killing" does have a better ring to it than simply "killing". I've had numerous conversations by this point where I stopped somebody who repeated this claim to ask them what it means and to provide any evidence it's happening. In some cases they didn't know what the word meant, and in every other case, they had no idea how to substantiate it. They just said it.

Joe Biden's [December 2023 statement](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67699255) that Israel was "starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place" is one of the earliest popular uses of the term that I could find when looking back, so perhaps he's partly to blame.

The idea that Israel is just randomly throwing bombs into Gaza with no regard for where they land may have come from the notion that Israel is using "dumb bombs" and misunderstandings about the implications of that term. In the mid-1900s, we started putting onboard computers and sensor systems onto some munitions to enable them to steer theirselves, which is useful if you're trying to shoot down a moving target like a plane or ensure your missiles remain accurate from long distances or in turbulent weather conditions. It didn't become common to use these until the 90s, and because this sort of technology was called 'smart' dumbs, literally all munitions prior became 'dumb' by comparison. When you fire a rifle, that's a dumb munition. And we obviously don't think that all bombing prior to the last few decades was "indiscriminate".

The difference between using smart and dumb munitions in many circumstances is also not significant. When a military plane drops a missile onto a building, it's generally going to go exactly where they target. If the argument being made is that Israel is being more destructive than necessary, perhaps the weight and blast radius of the bombs they're using, rather than whether they're smart or dumb bombs, is what should be called into question---but the destructive nature of their operation is already understood to be a deliberate attempt at destroy the Hamas-made tunnel infrastructure in northern Gaza, not a desire to increase civilian casualty numbers for no reason.

If you feel Israel has ended up causing too many civilian casualties, however this is determined, then some part of the blame should lie with Hamas for creating the circumstances in which civilian casualties are so difficult to keep low. They hide in the civilian population, they build their operations under schools and hospitals, they've forced Israel to fight in these civilian areas. It's all part of their strategy to use death counts as a tool of propaganda for their cause.

### The pager attack

In 2024, a bunch of pagers exploded in Lebanon. The next day, walkie-talkies. They were specifically the devices sold to members of Hezbollah, the terrorist group that's taken over southern Lebanon.

I recall people messaging me after that attack, asking what I thought, hoping that I'd condemn it. Not only do I not condemn it, but I don't see why it's not preferable to any other method of attack Israel could've pursued. They figured out a way to precision-target Hezbollah members: target the devices they were using to communicate with each other. It's a creative way of distinguishing between the actual militants and the civilian population. I realize there were some civilian injuries, but overall very few, and it's not like there's ever zero in war. Imagine we had the opportunity to bomb a house where all the top Nazis were having a meeting, but there were also some civilian cooks or other servants attending who would die. That would *obviously* be seen as an unfortunately cost necessary to take out valid military targets.

I remember some of the most anti-Israel people calling it a terrorist attack. It was *literally* terrifying in the sense it scared people, perhaps. If I were walking down the street, and I didn't realize the guy in front of me was a literal terrorist, and his phone suddenly exploded, then yeah, I might be freaked out a bit. But that's not actually what terrorism is. I read an article by somebody who said after this attack, every single person in the Middle East has to be scared their devices might blow up at any time if the IDF wants them dead. This is only true in the stupidest sense possible. If there's a war, and the enemy planes bomb a legitimate military target, like a military outpost full of soldiers in our military, then should I be scared that my house might be next? It could get bombed in the same way, by those same planes. It could happen. They have planes. They could fly over here and blow me up in my house. They could bomb my neighbourhood. By this logic, virtually any act of war is an act of terrorism, because it's a demonstration that you *could* attack the civilian population instead, and that makes them scared.

This reaction was just a way to spin the situation against Israel, even though it's an instance of Israel doing the exact opposite of targeting the civilian population, the exact opposite of the thing everybody is always trying to accuse them of (not caring about the militant--civilian distinction).

## How to move forward

In 2022, I felt Western countries should rethink our relationship with Israel if they want to maintain our support and have this cozy relationship with us. There are many troubling aspects of Israeli domestic politics. We should insist they end all settlements in the West Bank immediately. They should probably also surrender control of the Golan Heights.

However, I recognize that Israel cannot fully withdraw from the West Bank and end their blockade of Gaza without some kind of solution to the military threat in those regions posed by militant Islamists, who receive international support to continue their jihad against Israel in perpetuity. This probably requires a significant narrative shift within Palestine. They need to stop pushing anti-Jewish propaganda meant to incite people into endless hatred and warfare. They need to elevate the voices of Palestinian leaders who see that life can get better if they accept peace---but those voices won't have credibility if Israel is not willing to work with them and improve the situation as well.

I highly doubt this is something Israel is capable of doing on its own. Palestinians are not going to sit down and accept being ruled by Israel. It may require either Western or Arab countries to intervene, to police the Palestinian territories and prevent them from being taken over by violent extremists. The Iranian--Qatari project of funnelling support to these groups also needs to be addressed. Hamas and other extremist groups like them do not serve the interests of the Palestinians.

After the Oct-7 attack, some level of military response by Israel was justified. Hamas had declared war on Israel and invaded their borders to slaughter their people. The psychology of many Israelis in that moment was a demand for justice and for the rescuing of their people taken hostage, which is something Israeli leadership would've found difficult to ignore without a domestic political crisis. It was a tense situation, and something had to give.

However, the scale of destruction they've inflicted onto Gaza is broadly not considered justified. The way this response was executed should've been more open to international oversight and ethics rules, and with more pressure placed on them for restraint by their Western allies. If they couldn't be more coÃ¶perative with our demands, then we should have no part in supporting them, considering the high cost that we all knew would be endured by the two million or so inhabitants of Gaza, the vast majority of whom are innocents with little to no control of their situation.

I don't know what to say or do now that Donald Trump is in control of the American military, as he seems intent to protect Netanyahu

### What could Israel do to end the conflict?

Israel's current borders weren't agreed to diplomatically. They were armistice lines, meaning the implicit boundaries between sides during a war, like what you might see on a map of Europe half-way through WWII, or a map of the Russia--Ukraine war right now. When the fighting stopped, the dust settled, and that's where the lines remained. Israel didn't have the population nor military might to expand and hold territory without limit. They weren't conquerors. They could just barely manage to keep the land they inhabited.

**The situation Israel ended up in was this:** there are two regions on either side of the country they can't control, conquer, deport, or police. And the population of these two places both want to declare war on you and kill all your people. What do you do? It's a situation they can't deal with. A situation of their own making, you might say, but after some point that doesn't matter---they don't have a time machine to change the past. What do they do now?

For the latter part of the 20th century, there was basically nothing Israel could have done to create peace short of self-destruction, either in the form of all leaving the region or giving up on their political independence and allowing the region to be overtaken by a Muslim majority---which, given their experience in Europe after the Holocaust, and given the violently anti-Jewish nature of the population in question here, was obviously and understandably unacceptable. Ideally separation should eventually have led to peace, but that's not how things work out if one side is completely unsatisfied with separation because they demand your defeat at all costs and believe they have the power to accomplish that.

Today a solution proposed by critics of Israel is for Israel to end their blockade of Gaza and withdraw all presence from the West Bank, at least. These are agreeable goals, but Israel doesn't do these things for no reason. A huge portion of the people in Gaza do want to kill them all. The region does descend into being ruled by organized terrorist groups who want to wage against Israel. They take in substantial resources from outside, and they funnel those resources into trying to build bombs and other weapons, which they use to try and murder random Israelis. The Israeli blockade isn't there simply as a means to harm Gaza and keep them down; it's self-defensively motivated. Their presence in the West Bank is similar, except they can't possibly blockade that region as they can with Gaza. And for the people of Israel---who feel they're at war and that these people want to exterminate them and have been terrorizing their side for decades---simply backing off like this is a big ask. When a nation is attacked and given a *casus belli*, we don't demand they sit on their hands, even though that *would* result in peace. It becomes unfortunately unrealistic: almost nobody who feels they've just been attacked simply values peace. They want to respond. They care about the precedent being set for the future, they demand answers, they want to know this isn't just going to happen again. If you forgive and capitulate and appease, the problem often gets worse, not better. And that would be the case here. If Israel ended their blockade of Gaza, would the result be peace, or Hamas importing more weapons and getting ready for their next attack?

This does get more complicated with the West Bank, as there are some elements within Israel who want to rule the West Bank for religious, historical regions, even referring to this as "Greater Israel", which it's implied they have some kind of Biblical claim to. There are, moreover, people within Israel who feel total withdraw from the West Bank would be insufficient and solve nothing---those who want them dead before would still want them dead afterwards. It would be surrendering strategic territory for essentially no reason. The religious aspect of Israeli politics that aspires to reclaim some kind of historical Judea *is* a problem, but it's not also the dominant, majority voice in the country. It's just one of many voices present. The US Congress has some unreasonable people in it, too.

Gaza and the West Bank, when left to their own devices, fall apart into chaos and get taken over by extremist groups. They aren't stable regions, they don't have functioning institutions, the population is young and susceptible to radicalization. How do you fix this? There probably needs to be some kind of external, stabilizing element, and that being Israel itself is going to be rejected. It would be nice if Egypt, Jordan, or any other more stable Arab country that could control this population and prevent them from being terrorists and funnelling all their resources into trying to shoot rockets at Israelis, but those countries have no interest in doing this, because---as noted before---they would prefer the Palestinians linger around like this because it puts endless pressure on Israel, and because they don't want the trouble of dealing with the Palestinians in their own countries, nor committing the resources to come in and govern these places.

By the 21st century, Arab countries' attitudes toward Israel have shifted. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon---the actual governments of these other countries have largely abandoned the hope that if they carry on fighting, forever they'll eventually destroy Israel. The people who started these wars have died of old age; the people now in charge were born into conflict. They've become more interested in moving on, finding a way, and normalizing relations---and diversifying their economies. Things haven't fully developed in that way yet (*officially*, some of these countries, like Saudi Arabia, still don't even recognize Israel as a country), but that's the direction it's moved in, and is still moving in. For this reason, I feel there's more opportunity now, in theory, for Israel to normalize relations with the Palestinians by trying to directly help develop and improve these regions---but they likely can't force this outcome by theirselves.

What should Israel do? Leave the West Bank, you say. But if they leave the West Bank, what happens? If Israel up and leaves, the people in the West Bank start prepping for war. It just kicks the can down the road, and by the time you catch up with it again, the problem will be worse, not better. This is the bind Israel finds itself in: the conditions for their military occupation to end aren't being met. They can't just leave, they can't absorb the territory, and they can't expel everybody out of the territory, at least not without massive international condemnation. Here, like on other fronts, it can feel there's no right answer.

### What could Palestinians do to end the conflict?

This part of the conversation is difficult because the Palestinian population is generally treated as though it has no agency. And there is some truth to that. There are some valid reasons for why they do have less agency than other populations. For one, the average age in the region is very low. They're less educated, less organized, less wealthy, and frankly they've been propagandized for the last few generations. They have television, but they also have TV stations run by terrorist networks. They have children's programming created by fascistic Jihadists whose goal is teaching children born into Gaza about the evil of Jews. This population is not in a good state economically, socially, or mentally. So what can I realistically ask of them? This is an unfortunate barrier because a change in Palestinian people would be more impactful than similar changes among any other population. They have the most potential.

If Arab leadership outside of Palestine (and to clarify: 'Palestine' means Gaza and the West Bank) wanted to make this fabled "peace in the Middle East" happen, a key to reaching that outcome is figuring out how to regulate, deradicalize, and control the Palestinians---not to enslave them, but to control them as the governments of other countries control their own populations, by enforcing laws, and preventing violent paramilitary groups from running the streets and indoctrinating children, to prevent people from pouring all their resources into making rockets because they've come to believe their main purpose in life is trying to murder Jews. The conversation ends up feeling like we're talking about a friend who's a drug addict. We can say "they need to quit the drugs" all day long. And in a simple sense, that's true. It would solve the problem. But it's also a complicated thing to demand. They might need help.

But Palestinians don't have no agency at all. We talk about how many people there are in Palestine below the age of 18, but there's also plenty of adults. It's not impossible for people there to move in the direction of saying they don't want this to go on forever, and they need to recognize a different path to go down, one that isn't infinite, endless Jihad and warfare. Whether it comes from outside or in, what the Palestinian population needs to do is accept that Israel isn't going away, it's not getting wiped off the map. They need to focus on making life better for their own people. If they weren't constantly plotting and trying to kill the Jews, eventually the blockade would end, and their own lives could carry on. Israel isn't a repressive dictatorship whose public just wants blood and retribution for no reason. They want protection. And there are many people in Israel who are critical of the country's actions. They have plenty of public discourse and care about the morality of what they do. If Hamas and groups like them weren't regularly proving the need for Israel's policies, eventually the public would say, hey, wait, why are we blockading these people? What's the point? And it would be taken down.

### The two-state solution

The state-state solution sounds like the most obvious thing ever. It's what you're supposed to say if you just want to be normal, uncontroversial, and signal that you value life on both sides. It almost feels like you're not even taking a side. There's two populations that don't get along, but they reside in two separate territories with a clear boundary between them. Why not just declare these separate countries, let them organize their own governments, and have peace through separation?

In the past, Israel was willing to do that. It was the Arabs who opposed it. The Arabs always wanted *more*---more than whatever was offered to them. Even to this day, many anti-Zionists oppose a two-state solution because a two-state solution implies that Israel gets to keep existing. It's difficult to compromise with that level of extremism. They *need* Israel to be destroyed---either through the violent expulsion all Jews from the region (there *are* many people who want this), or by dismantling the country as it currently is and replacing it with a Muslim-majority state, leaving Jews to once again be a powerless minority living under another people's authority. Jews have no reason to expect anything other than oppression under such an arrangement. It simply cannot be accepted.

This uncompromising extremism is why over time, Israel has changed its position from being willing to compromise through a two-state solution to opposing that. How can you just back off and grant political independence to the same people declaring Jihad against you and trying to murder your people, your civilians? That is not a solution, but a delay---giving them time to regroup and reload. If any of us were Israeli, none of us would accept this.

I have come to think that if there is a solution ahead, "one-state or two-state?" is the wrong question. There will be Israel, and then somebody else probably needs to step in and do something about the Palestinians, because their independence at this point spells only perpetual war. What if other Arab countries were to step up and take over these regions? Egypt takes over Gaza, Jordan takes over the West Bank---but I don't think those two countries are capable of doing so right now, so perhaps other countries, like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, also commit to helping the situation. The point is Israel cannot do this alone. The Palestinians will likely not like this, and the rest of the world must reply, 'too bad'.

Then you need a narrative shift in the culture. They need to stop pushing anti-Jewish propaganda that's meant to incite the people in these regions to perpetual hatred and warfare. Teach them to be peaceful, tell them to accept their current borders, tell them that life can get better if they make peace. This needs to be a concerted effort akin to denazification in post-war Germany, which is not something Israel is equipped to do. It's not something the people are going to accept coming from them. They may be more inclined to accept it coming from their fellow Arabs and Muslims.

## Leftist groupthink

In recent years, the court of public opinion in the West has been shifting in a more anti-Israel direction. Israel had our sympathy after the Oct-7 attacks, but their military response has largely been considered disproportionate, inflicting too much destruction on too many people with seemingly little regard for civilian casualties. Consequently, our position on Israel has become a top priority for many left-wing voices, using it as their main litmus test to distinguish good from evil, and denouncing anybody who fails that test.

There has also been an alternative media sphere that's increasingly influenced by organized propaganda campaigns. There are young people today getting all their information about the world from social media, who don't realize how much anti-Israel bias they're surrounded by. It's become normal to them. There are whole networks of people who want to control the online narrative, pushing 'anti-Zionist' views in every comment section across TikTok, Reddit, Quora, Twitter, Youtube, and so on. You name it and there's a group-chat somewhere dedicated to brigading it. And it doesn't stop with Israel. There's a whole radicalization pipeline that tries to pull people in a far-left, anti-Western direction, using Israel as its starting point. Even if you fully condemn Israel, there is something insidious about the way this discourse is taking place online, and there are serious problems with where a lot of people are ending up when they come the other side.

Even when it pertains to things I agree with, I often resent this type of group-identity meta-politics where everybody is pressured into adopting the latest *correct opinion* on penalty of exile. This often reduces the expression of that opinion into a superficial group-identity performance---"look at me everybody, I'm saying the thing I'm supposed to say!"---and it increases the danger of purity spiralling, i.e. people trying to one-up each other in their enthusiasm and zealotry for the cause in question because it's socially rewarding in such an environment to do so. We go from "Israel is doing something bad that we should oppose", to "Israel has no 'right to exist' and should be destroyed", to "every Jewish person in Israel is a valid military target to the brave Hamas freedom fighters", and suddenly you've lost the plot and just become a crazy person.

The way many left-wing communities act about Israel is unthinking and cult-like, treating the whole conflict as black-and-white, morally uncomplicated, lacking in any nuance, offering no room for disagreement or compromise---anybody who would dare to disagree is simply outcast as evil, and therefore doesn't need to be compromised with. They speak about the issue with absolute moral conviction and self-righteousness. They're also very controlling about language, requiring that everybody they talk to does so on their terms, by their definitions, conceding to all the labels and framing that they insist on. Even just disagreeing about the language---e.g. if they say Israel is engaging in "apartheid" and you don't think that's an apt description---is enough to be outcast as evil.

And then they begin turning on each other. Even the most progressive, most left-wing politicians are attacked by the Palestine mob for being insufficiently extreme. Being reasonable angers them. This is all the more reason to talk about the issue.

I've made a similar criticism in the past about LGBT politics, where I often agreed with the claim in dispute (e.g. "trans women are women"), but I wouldn't support using agreement with that claim as our dividing line between good and evil, nor was I comfortable with how completely intolerant some people had become to disagreement. The MO became "agree with the following claims or you're banned". It resulted in some people being unfairly maligned and alienated, it resulted in purity spiralling toward ever more radical positions, and it resulted in community spaces that were paradoxically unwelcoming because it was so easy to make a small mistake and get kicked out that everybody had to walk on eggshells while they were there.

This is part of what motivates me to talk about Israel--Palestine: not only because the topic itself is interesting and consequential, and as people with political agency we have a moral duty to care about whether or not we're supporting evil things, but also because my feeling is there's something of an angry mob trying to control the discourse about all this, polarizing everybody into one of two camps (pressuring anyone who starts off with reasonable criticism of Israel into adopting increasingly extremist and unreasonable positions, while greatly overstating the wickedness of normal, moderate people on the other side), and ultimately poisoning the well in a way that harms every left-wing political party. Which, in the current age of right-wing insanity, is a high price to pay. We need more people who are willing to stand up for sanity, who are not so terrified of disagreeing with the most radical left-wing positions.

*If my views or attitude about this topic change significantly at some point in the future, I'll hopefully make another post where I describe in what way that happens. I'm not unmovingly committed to anything that I've said here and I'm open to dialogue about any of it.*
