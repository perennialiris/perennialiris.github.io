# Israel--Palestine

||date
2025-07-27

Israel--Palestine feels like the most divisive, polarizing issue these days. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. Are you siding with the terrorists, fascists, theocrats, antisemites, the people who target civilians and use their own people as human shields? No, wait---are you siding with the apartheid state that's trying to genocide the Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor. It feels like no matter what you say, some portion of the population will end up hating you.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. It's strained some of mine. I'm willing to take that risk over certain issues, where if somebody disagrees with me I'd prefer they know. But as this topic was so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, let alone change their minds, and was not immediately relevant to my country's politics anyway (most voters didn't care much about conflicts on the other side of the world), for years my position was that it wasn't worth getting into, so I largely avoided the conversation. And this is what many people in society did as well, until the [October 7 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks) pulled the conflict back into the spotlight and made it fashionable to have a strong opinion about.

As debate about Israel--Palestine now seems unavoidable and is in the public interest (i.e. I'm now *expected*, in a way that I wasn't a few years ago, to have a clear position about it), I've here compiled my own thoughts about every aspect of the scenario I can think of. If you want to argue with me about it, you can direct me to what part of this page you disagree with.

## Terms clarification

To make this all more accessible, let's start with some maps and definitions of key terms.

20-4.png|The Jordan River


||table
**Gaza**, or the **Gaza Strip** | the small territory in the western corner of Israel, a densely-populated area with a few major cities (the main one, in the north, is called Gaza city, and is *sometimes* also referred to simply as Gaza---pay attention for that); many of its residents are descendents of refugees displaced from Israel in the 1940s (many others went to Jordan)
**West Bank** | the larger Palestinian territory on the **east** side of Israel, so called because it's the west bank of the Jordan River, the natural feature that separates Israel from Jordan
**Palestine**, or the **Palestinian territories** | the combination of the West Bank and Gaza ("Palestine" historically referred to the whole area, including what is now Israel, so now it just means "the part that's not Israel")
the **Golan Heights**, or the **Golan** | the region between Israel and Syria, effectively controlled by Israel (Israel annexed it in 1981); this is considered an illegal occupation; international organizations consider it an Israeli-occupied part of Syria
**Hamas** (the Islamic Resistance Movement) | this can refer to the civil government of Gaza (since 2007), but also to its affiliated militant Islamist wing; the intended meaning varies by context, though the latter use (talking about the terrorist wing) is more common
**Hezbollah** (Party of Allah) | the militant Islamist group that operates in southern Lebanon, which has infiltrated the Lebanon government and exists as a parallel force within Lebanon
the **Houthis** | the militant Islamist group that controls western Yemen (they came to prominence in 2014, but gained more attention in 2023 after they started attacking ships passing through the Red Sea)
the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (the PLO), as represented by the **Palestine Authority** (or the **Palestine National Authority**) | a national coalition meant to represent the Palestinian population (founded 1964); the official representative of Palestine at the United Nations (since 1974);---it was initially labelled a terrorist group and its stated goal was the total destruction of Israel, but it became more moderate over time; the [Oslo accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords) (1993--1995) placed the Palestinian territories under control of the **Palestine Authority**, a governing body controlled by [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah), the largest party within the PLO coalition;---the Palestine Authority still controls the West Bank to this day, but notably they *lost* control of Gaza to Hamas in 2006
**IDF** | Israeli Defense Forces (the Israeli military)
**Mossad** | common name for the Israeli national intelligence agency; derived from the Hebrew for *institution*
**Zionism** | the movement started by Jews in late-19th century Europe to create a state in the Middle East where Jewish people could be the majority and ergo have political self-determination; the name originates from Mount Zion, a location in Jerusalem, which is considered the historical home of the Jewish people

## Why care about this topic?

It's common when talking about Israel--Palestine for people to accuse one another of having the worst of intentions. This makes dialogue very challenging. How can you find common ground with somebody who's just plain evil? I become disinterested when somebody accuses me of either only criticizing Israel because I hate Jews, or of only defending Israel because I hate Arabs or Muslims. At that point we're no longer talking about Israel--Palestine, but having a meta-conversation about my motivation for trying to do so. And if that's truly what somebody believes about me, then I don't know why they would want to talk to me anyway.

There *is* a realistic danger of people being guided through this topic by bad intentions. When it comes to a person who's very supportive of Israel, they could be motivated by racism and dehumanization of Arabs or Muslims. There are people who think of the Palestinians as uncivilized, savages, as people who are incapable of peace, incapable of living in modern society, who are naturally violent and intolerant and drawn to terrorism, and who ultimately as nothing more than a nuisance, and they wouldn't mind if Israel just decided to wipe them out all already. They act as though all Palestinians are guilty of the actions of terrorist groups, and they also weaponize the fact Palestinians have an Islamic culture that is repressive of homosexuality and of women's rights, as though being born into such a culture is a crime for which the Palestinians deserve some kind of cosmic punishment.

And then, when it comes to people who are very critical of Israel, the fear is they could be motivated by antisemitism, or a bias against Jewish people. They fixate on Israeli wrongdoing, while ignoring all other wars, conflicts, and cruelty elsewhere in the world, even just elsewhere in the Middle East. They seem to care about international law, but really only care when Israel is violating it. They seem to care about genocidal and dehumanizing rhetoric, except when it's directed against Jews. They often fall into believing conspiracy theories about Jews pulling the strings in Western governments, manipulating our foreign policy, and controlling our media. They claim it's impossible for Jewish people to be the majority without turning into genocidal monsters for some reason. They offer endless compassion and understanding for Arabs who engage in terrorism, but none at all for innocent Jews born into Israel, surrounded by people who want them dead, growing up learning about how most of their people's history has been fleeing persecution.

I'm wary of either possibility, and I do what I can to combat racist or dehumanizing speech in our community. I will argue that most Palestinians are unworthy of scorn or hatred, that they're our fellow human beings and how we treat them matters---including those of them who are actually in terrorist groups, which is not the majority. As I've said before, the greatest test of your morality is how you treat somebody who's at your mercy. I likewise try to be wary about how Jewish people are treated and spoken of, which in my case---because I tend to interact with more left-wing people than right-wing these last few years---has so far been the greater of two struggles.

I've many times heard it asked why people in the West care so much about the topic anyway. The implication can be that a person's focus on it, of all things, is evidence that moves us toward thinking they have bad motives. But we must admit there are plenty of legitimate reasons for a person in the West to be very attentive to the Israel--Palestine conflict, and even to give it far more attention than wars or conflicts elsewhere in the world. Consider the many points of entry at which a person could become acutely aware of it in the first place:

* We are all likely to become *aware* of Israel because our history classes invariably teach about World War II, the Holocaust, and the League of Nations. In this way, the founding of Israel feels related to our own history, and what happens there may feel like our fault or our responsibility, which can give somebody motivation to care how it turns out.
* We could hear about it each election cycle, when some of our politicians get on stage and clarify their support for Israel. It's something they get asked about in debates. I specifically recall that in past elections in my home country of Canada, the Conservative Party would include their support for Israel as a list item somewhere on their party platform on their website. I don't believe any other countries were explicitly mentioned like this. I understand why somebody thought to include it on that page, but I can also understand a person unfamiliar with the conflict seeing that and thinking, hey, what gives? Is that something I should be worried about? Why is this country so important that politicians feel the need to talk about it, of all things? In this way, the emphasis, the idea that it should stand out among all other conflicts in the world, is really given to us by society.
I can also imagine that if people in my government were all expected to have a position on what's happening in Andorra, then I would instantly want to know more about what's happening there than I do now, which is practically nothing (the fact I can point to it on a map likely places me as above-average for Andorra-related knowledge). Then, if I found out the Andorran government were doing things I find gravely immoral, I might be upset if so many people in our government wanted to keep sending them aid.
* The Israel--Palestine conflict has become noteworthy because of its longevity. It's been going on for so long, and is so commonly seen as intractable, that for much of my life "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline, a simile for an unrealistic goal that you don't know how to achieve. This itself can make people curious: what could be so difficult about it? Why *hasn't* the world been able to get these two groups to stop fighting and killing each other after so long? There must be something about it, right?
* There's been more activism on behalf of the Palestinian cause than for either side of many other issues. We could ask why that is---but we could also step back and realize it's not any one person's fault this is the case. We can't blame somebody for being more aware of Israel--Palestine than they are of the Boko Haram insurgence in Nigeria when they grew up in an environment where their peers were talking about one more than the other.
* In some cases, the person might also be Jewish, be of Middle Eastern descent, or have a close friend who is. This gives them a personal connexion to the conflict. It's certainly not limited that, but it happens, and though you'll encounter a lot of white people who don't have an explanation like this (me, for instance), the percentage of people who at least know either a Jewish or Middle Eastern person is probably fairly high in some places.

Then, once you start looking into Israel--Palestine, you find so much material, so many different stories, and it branches out into so many other topics, that it can easily keep you occupied for a long time. It leads to discussion and debate about the history of the region, which is told differently depending on whom you ask; to talking about how we feel about our history of imperialism and colonialism, what impact these high-level policy decisions made by diplomats and emperors in fancy rooms could have on the lives of powerless people in villages far away, and what obligation we have to deal with the lingering effects of past injustice, and how; to talking about international law, the laws of armed conflict, how they're interpreted, how they should be enforced, and whether our current international laws are perfect and should be deferred to at all times or whether they might actually have problems or limitations; and even to discussing fundamental questions about the very nature of a country or a national identity---like, what does it mean to be a Palestinian? What is a valid or invalid basis on which to found a country?

I can think about how my own experience with the conflict began with wanting to know the origin of the current

## Intuitions

Let's take a few steps back. Imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine and you're approaching it for the first time, intent on forming a position. You have no bias about it, you haven't been influenced to think one way or another, you're just a normal person who doesn't hate Jews or Muslims. If you started looking into the topic today, or perhaps a few years ago before the recent war escalated, what would be your initial impression? It depends. The conflict triggers different intuitions depending on who's examining it. We aren't bound to those first intuitions, but many people never move past them, because most people have better things to do than thoroughly challenge own intuitions about a complex topic like this. Regardless, what sort of thoughts come to mind for you? Let's consider some possibilities.

#### 1. Favour the side that does less bad stuff.

If it's a war between two sides, then maybe we should just ask which side is morally worse. If you look at Israel and then at groups like Hamas or Hezbollah, there's a lot about each of them to lead a normal person to figure Israel is less bad---perhaps not angels, but further from devils. They have a better system of government, better laws, better culture, they do better on women's rights, gay rights, religious tolerance, freedom of speech, democracy, adherence to international norms. Who would rather side with the Islamist fascists? I'd much rather live in Tel Aviv.

#### 2. Choose the side that aligns with us.

If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and wants to be our friend and is happy to work with us, and is a generally valuable asset in our broader goals in the region, then maybe we should shrug and pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is a good ally to the West, and if we decided that wasn't important anymore, it's not like we could feasibly switch sides anyway because Israel's enemies all hate us. This, realistically, it how many people are approaching the issue (including all our politicians). "Israel wants to be our friend, and the people who they're fighting hate us, ergo Israel is the side we're on; the end."

#### 3. Favour the underdog.

With great power comes great responsibility. If one side of a conflict is far more wealthy and powerful than the other, then they're the ones who are really in control, and they have a greater responsibility to act properly and direct the conflict in a moral way. In this case, Israel is holding all the cards while the Palestinians are oppressed, so if the state of things is unacceptable, then Israel is the country we should be blaming and expecting to make a change. This is another common perspective with a broad psychological appeal.

#### 4. Defend the native population.

If we're invading a country and taking over the native people there, then we're the baddies, right? It probably doesn't become okay just because we can find some aspect of their culture we find immoral, which is, indeed, a tactic that colonialists utilized, like with widow-burning in India, or human sacrifice in Mesoamerica.

This is an intuition that you can cast onto the Middle East, as some people view Israel a country of people who are foreign to the area and therefore colonizers, whereas Palestinians are the natives who were there first. This means before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same piece of land, Israel has less legitimacy, and Palestinians are in the right in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as an extension of a broader Western interest in having some levers of power in the Middle East, which could be something a person opposes, especially if their political views are especially far left.

In actuality, many Israelis are not "foreigners" at all, even if we ignore that this region is where Jewish people originated long ago. In the early years of Zionism, there were a lot of Jewish settlers from Europe who helped increase the population, but today the majority are Jews born in Israel, many of them descended from Jewish families that fled to Israel from elsewhere in the Middle East, meaning they're not even of European origin. Nonetheless, this intuition is persuasive for some people.

#### 5. Oppose Jewish influence.

Jewish people have long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the West, there are people whose view of Israel is they're manipulators, that they attacked the USS *Liberty*, that they had something to do with 9/11, they use their control of media companies and AIPAC to control American foreign policy, they want to drag us into wars in the Middle East for their own benefit. They side against Israel in their conflict with the Arab world because they think of Israelis as nefarious Jews whom they want nothing to do with. This is more common among right-wing people, especially conspiracy theorists, though many of their memes and arguments have infected the left as well.

#### 6. Be mindful of our prejudice.

Liberal people try to be self-aware about the danger of bias and prejudice, and compensate for that in their evaluation of things. In the Israel--Palestine conflict they may see a danger of siding with Israelis because Palestinians are poorer, they're Muslims, and they're seen as less "white" than Jews (because of how European Jews are portrayed in Western media---in actuality, many Jews look more like other Middle Eastern peoples). To counteract this prejudice hazard, Jews are placed under a higher level of scrutiny, because we're trying to self-reflect and check ourselves. So in practice, this works out in the Palestinians' favour.

#### 7. Anti-American bias.

A far-left tendency is to oppose the US exerting control around the world. They criticize everything that happens in international affairs through the lens of wanting to reduce the American sphere of influence. In the Israel--Palestine conflict, they view Israel as an extension of American interests, or as a puppet of the US, being used as a divide to destabilize the Middle East for our own purposes. Israel's very existence is therefore opposed, and the countries that want to destroy Israel are often favoured. The people who fall into this also hate Saudi Arabia (an American ally) and hate Iran and China (American enemies).

Of these, which intuition(s) do you find most appealing? When I first began trying to sort out all my thoughts about this conflict, the one that affected my thinking the most was the first example I listed: "choose the side that does less bad stuff". That's just part of how I navigate conflicts. If you were to tell me a war just broke out between two factions in any other random country on the planet and I had to take a side, I would start by asking which faction is less evil.

In applying that lens to Israel--Palestine, I made the following observations:

* Israel's government is something like a middling European democracy---flawed, but aspiring in the right direction. They have freedom of speech, they allow vocal criticism of the government, you're allowed to form opposition parties and vote the current government out of power. Their military is also held to a far higher standard than any other in the region. There are some problematic aspects of Israeli society, but in terms of its overall character, it's far less oppressive than average for this part of the world.
* The terrorist groups Israel is at war with aren't seeking freedom; they're basically fascists. They want to implement an authoritarian, theocratic society powered by radical Islam. And in their fight to destroy Israel, they have virtually no ethics, they have no respect for international law, they have no regard for civilian deaths, no, all bets are off, they're willing to do anything it takes to win. This is not a normal "resistance movement", it's a resistance movement that's been hijacked by crazy people.
* Hamas and other Islamist groups openly proclaim their goal is not ending the occupation of Palestine, but the eradication of Jews and the complete destruction of Israeli society. They say not death to Israelis, but death to the Jews---and that's not a mistake; they're well aware of the distinction. They aren't against Arab Israelis, and non-Israeli Jews don't get a pass. If they got their way, they would carry out a second Holocaust.

For me, this formed a reasonable basis for leaning toward support for Israel, but I still had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort to brutality *after decades of injustice* cancel out that initial injustice? No. If Israel is imposing unjust conditions onto the Palestinians, then any intuition about Israel seeming to operate in a more moral way in the present can't be the end of the story.

If you aren't sure what I mean, imagine a slave society where some people are owned as property. A group of rebel slaves break free and rampage through the streets. They kill whole families, they rape women, they laugh while doing it. I could say these rebels had done something immoral, and that would be true---but their actions being immoral doesn't speak to whether the conditions of slavery were justified to begin with. It would be a mistake to let that distract me from also condemning the latter, which is actually the far greater crime overall.

An immoral thing can appear better than it is when it becomes part of a system that legitimizes it through rules and procedure, and people grow used to it over time. What if the system itself is evil? What if we've grown accustomed to evil? This is what the Palestinian cause demands we investigate. Is there something abhorrent and unacceptable about the status quo, like slavery, that Palestinians are forced to endure, and which it would be wrong of us to overlook while condemning the latest Hamas attack?

To answer that, you have to examine the history of the conflict.

## The history of the conflict

Even before Nazi Germany, Jews were mistreated in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904), a Jewish man born in what is today Budapest, founded modern **Zionism** by proposing (in 1895) that Jews should unite and form a state of their own, rather than try to assimilate to their host nations, as many Jews were then attempting. Herzl came to believe that Jews could never truly feel secure living as a minority in Christian Europe, where Jews were, despite their best efforts, forever victims of antisemitism, treated with suspicion, called aliens and outsiders, used as scapegoats, and periodically massacred in pogroms that destroyed whole Jewish communities. It was just one tragedy after another going back centuries. The movement Herzl started lived on in the decades after his early death, and the case for his proposal would only become stronger as events unfolded.

Zionism was a secular movement, focused less on Judaism as a religion and more on the Jews as a people. It was named after Zion, or Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, which was poetically as a metonym for Jerusalem itself, or for all of Israel, via the ancient kingdom of Israel. The name signified that if Jewish people were to have a homeland, it ought to be in the place their people were from historically, which was, indisputably, the region of Palestine, where once were the ancient Jewish kingdoms of Israel and Judea, where Soloman's Temple was built in 957 BC to house the Ark of the Covenant, from which the Jews were exiled to Babylon (modern Iraq) and have been living as a diaspora ever since.

But in the late 19th century, for the Jews to create a state in Palestine wasn't yet feasible. Two important events created opportunity, the second being the displacement of Jews from much of Europe by Nazi Germany, and the first being **World War I** (1914--1918). As a consequence of WWI, the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled a large part of the Middle East from its capital in Constantinople, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides of the war, and Britain supporting an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule (1916). The following year, with WWI still ongoing, Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary and former Prime Minister, declared that, after the war, Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in a region called Palestine, then under Ottoman control. His letter of support to the Jewish community is now known as the **Balfour declaration**. It was deliberately vague, not defining its terms or specifying an exact location, region size, or proposed boundaries. It was simply to be "in Palestine".

There were already problems. A year before the Balfour declaration, Britain made promises to Arab leaders to recognize Arab independence after the war---though, like the Balfour declaration, their promises weren't very specific, and people would later argue over the correct interpretation of what either side even really said. This traces back to a series of letters in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahon--Hussein correspondence**, between British diplomat Henry McMahon and Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi (1854--1931), the Sharif of Mecca who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. A proponent of pan-Arabism (a desire for all Arab nations to form a single Arab state), Hussein declared himself caliph after the war, but detested the Balfour declaration and refused to coöperate with the British (e.g. he refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles). This eventually led to the British supporting Ibn Saud, who in 1925 conquered Hejaz and took Mecca, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

20-8.png|The Sykes--Picot Agreement (modern borders faded)

In 1916, Britain also made a secret agreement with France and other countries called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement**, which would partition control of Ottoman territory in the Levant after the war. There would be areas directly under British control, some under French control, and some Arab states but divided into English and French spheres of interest. Palestine, because it contained sites of religious and cultural significance to Jews and Muslims, was going to be carved out separately and put under international control of some kind, with the details varying as the agreement went through different iterations. These talks meant Britain couldn't promise lands north of the Sykes--Picot line, where French influence began. In 1920, despite any earlier plans, the United Nations gave Britain an explicit mandate to control Palestine until it could become self-governing, and it became known as **Mandatory Palestine** while under British control.

After WWI, the Ottoman empire had lost its Arabian territories and was in a state of near-collapse, its power mostly limited to the Anatolian plateau around Constantinople, and the Allies were trying to prosecute members of the Ottoman government for their role in the Armenian genocide (1915--17). The Ottoman Sultan who ruled throughout most of WWI, Mehmed V, had just died shortly before the end of the war, and his half-brother, Mehmed VI, inherited the situation. What little power MehMed VI had was then challenged by the rising Turkish Nationalist movement, led by Atatürk, the man himself. Allied forces then occupied Constantinople, and so began the **Turkish War of Independence** (1919--23), in which Turkish Nationalists fought to repel the Allies from the country, formally ended the Ottoman Empire (1922), and established the modern republic of Turkey (1923). (Constantinople was officially renamed to Istanbul in 1930.)

A lot was changing in the world. Countries were rising and falling, borders being redrawn, and in the background, millions of normal people were picking up their lives and migrating to avoid conflict and to be part of the communities of their choice. In the interwar period (1918--39), tens of thousands of Jewish people continued migrating into Mandatory Palestine, settling new towns, developing farmland, but also leading to conflict and tension with the Arab population in that area. The British even limited how many Jews were allowed to migrate to the region in the 20s because they noticed it was leading to problems, and it was still their responsibility to keep the peace. Though some Jewish people had always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to them at this time was exacerbated by the perception they were Europeans, foreigners coming into the region from abroad---a tragically ironic fate for the Jews, considered aliens both in Europe and in the Levant. (In the following decades, many Jews throughout the rest of the Middle East would flee persecution to Israel, and so Israel became less "European" the more time went by.)

20-2.png|UN Res. 181 (passed 1947)|A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region---not carelessly in half, but with respect to the existing population and its demography while trying to create a Jewish-majority region per the wishes of the Zionist movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would end up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' would've been only barely majority-Jewish. In other words, they put as many Muslims as possible into the Jewish side without going over half, then gave the rest to Muslims as well. On the other hand, this resulted in the Jewish side having more land per person. The city of Jerusalem, with its historical and religious importance to both Jews and Muslims, would by set up as a 

Arabs viewed the partition plan as unfairly benefitting the Jews. They boycotted participation in the negotiations, and refused to accept any partition plan proposed. The UN passed the resolution anyway (1947), and fighting between Jews and Muslims broke out across the country (1948 Palestine war), but British forces did little to intervene and simply began withdrawing from the region, leaving everybody to fend for theirselves. Just as the British Mandate officially ended, the newly constituted State of Israel declared its independence (1948-05-14), and both sides prepared for war. The armies of all surrounding Arab countries---Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen---would invaded the region (1948 Israel--Palestine war), but Israel fought back and somehow held its own, leading to a stalemate in 1949, and then to all countries involved signing an armistice agreement in 1949. The armistice lines (where the armies on both sides were pushed up to when the fighting stopped) became the de facto borders of Israel for the next few decades. Notably, the city of Jerusalem was cut in half, with Israel controlling the west and Jordan controlling the east.

For Israelis, this was a victory. They had to fight for it, lives were lost, and they didn't get all the territory they hoped for, but they finally had a country to call their own. It was even in their ancestral homeland, where they had access to historical religious sites, including the literal hill they call 'Mount Zion' (though the Temple Mount, site of the first temple built by King Soloman, considered the holiest site in Judaism, remained under Jordan's control in East Jerusalem until 1967).

However, as part of the fighting in the first part of the 1948 war, Israeli forces attacked Muslim Arabs all across the territory they controlled, and hundreds of Palestinian villages were looted and destroyed. In total, by the end of it, around 700,000 Arabs had fled or were directly expelled, most of them going to the remaining Palestinian territories then controlled by Egypt and Jordan, where they built new lives as refugees. Arabs today refer to this year of violent displacement as **the Nakba** (Arabic for *catastrophe*), which became the uniting story of Palestinian identity.

^1. A caliph is a Muslim ruler who claims to be the successor to the prophet Muhammad, and therefore implicit leader of the entire Muslim world. The region ruled by a caliph is called a caliphate, and there have been many caliphates throughout history. The Ottoman Sultan was generally considered a caliph, including by Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi, and the Ottoman Empire could also have been called the Ottoman Caliphate (though for various reasons this wasn't officially used).
2. In modern English, "mount" is often associated with mountains, like Mount Everest or Mount Fuji, but in the past it was used more loosely for any elevated ground. The hill called "Mount Zion" wasn't an important geographical feature; it was noteworthy because that's where they built the city of Jerusalem. Nobody knows what "Zion" originally meant, beyond that it was the name people used for that area.

### The pro-Israeli, Western perspective

Why have so many people in the West been pro-Israel for so long? A big part of it is they had a compelling, heroic narrative. The Jews were a powerless, persecuted minority, victims of the most terrible genocide of all time. Even after liberating them from the Nazis, many powerful Western countries didn't care about them. Jewish refugees were turned away, rejected, and continued to be treated badly. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. How could they? So they united, they came together in solidarity and resistance, and the created their own space where they could feel safe and have autonomy. They were attacked, but they persevered and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who wanted them all dead. It was glorious, the ultimate comeback story.

Today, the underdog mentality benefits Palestinians, but during the Cold War, it played for Israel. Just look at them on a map, surrounded by larger countries with bigger populations. Israel was the underdog in the Middle East. And while the rest of the world was fighting for democracy against the threat of Communism, Israel was on our side. They were the only democracy in the Middle East, while significant parts of the Arab world, like Egypt and Syria, were allied with the Soviets. The USSR distributed anti-Zionist propaganda depicting the Jews as puppets of the US, and supported the Palestinian cause, especially into the 1970s when both the US and USSR became more directly invested in the conflict.

Israel's victories felt like our victories. They were our friend, beating up our enemies. That's how it felt for people alive at the time. And then Reagan told Gorbachev to tear down that wall, everybody clapped, the USSR fell apart, the American space program put a man on the moon, there was Elvis, Michael Jackson, rock and roll, Sunday morning football, a good paying job down at the plant, and it all blurs together into this collective memory a time when it kicked ass to be American. Then 9/11 happened. The American public was completely unprepared for the trauma that having a foreign enemy attack them on their own territory would inflict. Suddenly everybody realized there was a group of people called Muslims, and they didn't like them or want to see them on airplanes. The lesson was that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, Muslims were the ones who hated you and burned the American flag, so apparently Jews are on our side, becausea enemy of my enemy and all that.

But now we're getting into a generational divide. If you were born in the late 90s or onward, you might barely remember 9/11 or what the world was like before it. For you, Israel was just some country on the other side of the world that all your politicians felt the need to mention when trying to get your parents to vote for them, and then you looked it up and learned it was doing some bad stuff. Israel is now wealthy and powerful, and the big countries they're surrounded by aren't really enemies anymore. Now they're just fighting small militias along its border. They're not the underdogs anymore. We see footage of Israeli soldiers, and we look at the neighbourhoods in Gaza, and suddenly it feels like Israel is the oppressor bullying the little guys. The fight has been reframed from "Israel vs. all the Arab countries" to just "Israel vs. the Palestinians", and now the Palestinians are the underdogs.

### The Arab perspective

In Western Arabia, along the eastern coast of the Red Sea, there is **Mecca**, the holiest city in Islam, birthplace of the prophet Muhammad, and location of the Kaaba, the cube-shaped Mosque that millions of Muslims make a pilgrimage to visit each year, and in whose direction all Muslims around the world face daily in prayer. For centuries, Mecca was controlled by the (non-Arab) Ottoman Empire, though often through a vassal-state called the Sharifate of Mecca. (A Sharifate means rule by a *Sharif*, a religious leader who claims to be descended from the prophet Muhammad's grandson.)

In 1908, **Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi** was appointed to be the new Sharif of Mecca. Hussein grew critical of the Ottoman Empire as the Young Yurk Revolution earlier that year resulted in a party called the **Committee of Union and Progress** gaining significant power, existing alongside and eventually usurping almost all *de facto* power from the sultan. The CUP then began persecuting non-Turkish ethnic minorities as part of their goal to "Turkify" the region, leading to the Armenian genocide on order of the CUP's leader, Talaat Pasha, during which Hussein helped save thousands of Armenians.

After WWI started, Hussein learned the CUP planned on deposing him, so he sided with the Allies. Britain, meanwhile, was trying to maintain the support of the Muslim world after Mehmed V declared a holy war against them in 1914, calling on all Muslims living in Allied-controlled countries to revolt in support of the Ottomans (many did). These factors led to the *quid pro quo* in the McMahon--Hussein correspondence, and to Hussein launching the **Arab Revolt** against the Ottomans in 1916. Hussein then declared himself king of all Arab countries, though the Allies didn't accept this and recognized him only as the king of a new country called Hejaz. After the Ottoman Empire was formally dissolved in 1924, Hussein declared himself the new caliph, with the support of the now-deposed Ottoman caliph, Mehmed VI. Though he was forced to abdicate from his position the following year after being attacked by Ibn Saud (which is why Saudi Arabia controls Mecca today), Hussein still had a significant influence as the "father of pan-Arabism", and his sons became the kings of Iraq (Faisal I, r. 1921--33) and Jordan (Abdullah I, r. 1921--51).

Not all Arab states were immediately advocates of pan-Arabism (as in forming a singular Arab super-country), but they were embracing Arab unity and rejecting Western powers interfering in the Arab world. They felt betrayed by the West after, instead of leaving and allowing the region to be controlled by the Arab forces that had just helped them overthrow the Ottomans, Britain and the United Nations wanted to install a Jewish state, populated by tens of thousands of settlers from Europe, right in the heart of the Middle East. It turns out this is what they were planning even before Hussein started his revolt. The UN proposed the borders of this new Jewish state would stretch all the way down to the Gulf of Aqaba, dividing the Arab world in two. It meant you couldn't get from the Sinai to Arabia without going through Israeli territory. Muslims in Egypt, then the most powerful Arab country, would no longer be able to travel to Mecca by land without the Jews' permission.

From the Arab perspective, the whole situation was already objectionable before any fighting started. The creation of Israel, in that location, with those borders, without any Arab states being consulted? Then when Jewish militants began attacking the Muslim community in Palestine (in 1948), and expelling thousands from their homes, creating a refugee crisis in the region, the Arab powers knew they had to react. This couldn't go on. A few years prior, in 1945, the **Arab League** had been formed, headquartered in Egypt. Its founding member-states weren't ready to surrender their sovereignty, but through the Arab League declared their intent to coöperate and strengthen their ties, and expressed jointly, through the League's charter, their dissatisfaction with the lack of independence granted to Palestine after World War I. This is why a few years later, when Israel declared its independence in 1948, all the Arab League's founding members (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Syria) attacked Israel together as a united front.

For decades, the Arab world refused to officially recognize Israel, considering it nothing more than an illegitimate occupier of Arab land, a thorn in their side they couldn't get rid of. That's why their position was not one of compromise, but the demand that Israel be completely dissolved. Why settle for less? This only began changing a generation or so later, with the Camp David Accords in 1978, when Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with and recognize Israel, to the chagrin of their fellow Arab League members. Eventually, Palestine itself, and then Jordan, would do the same. The people alive in Israel, and the rest of the Middle East, today aren't the same people who were at war in the 1940s. Eventually, you have to move on and put old conflicts to rest.

### Why does the conflict persist to this day?

The grievance that has never gone away concerns the 1948 expulsion of 700,000 people from Israel. How do we contextualize this number? It's smaller than most major cities, but roughly the same as the current metro populations of Leicester, England; Madison, Wisconsin; or Dresden, Germany. So imagine if everybody were displaced from any of these places. The only time this kind of thing happens in the West is when there's a natural disaster. Hurricane Katrina, the cyclone that hit the US Gulf coast in 2005, stands as the most significant example. It temporarily displaced 1.5 million people, and though most of them were able to return eventually, around 100,000 people never did, in many cases because their homes were completely destroyed and they continued their lives elsewhere. But even if 7 times more people were permanently displaced, to match the number of Arabs displaced in the Nakba, it wouldn't feel the same because the people displaced by Katrina who never came back to their old towns weren't forcibly prevented from doing so if they really wanted to, nor was there a conscious entity for us to blame and hold accountable for the storm's destruction.

We could look to other population transfers that took place in the 20th century. The largest was the partition of British India, creating the modern India and Pakistan, wherein roughly 15 million people moved in one direction or the other (Muslims to Pakistan and Bangladesh, Hindus and Sikhs to India), and another million or so people died in the process, as chaos and violence erupted all across the countryside. This was probably the largest human migration of all time, and might never be surpassed (unless climate change leads to an event that tops it). In an event like this, there are some people who leave their towns because they're enthusiastic to go join the other side, while others leave because they fear what life may be like if they remain on the "wrong" side after the dust settles, and some people are directly attacked and chased out, as longstanding resentment between groups rises to the surface for one last hurrah. How many people were in each category after the fact is then difficult to say. We don't know how many people would've left if there were no violence at all. We don't know how many of those who left out of fear actually would've been fine if they stayed, as many people did. But we can be sure the number of people coerced into leaving was more than zero, and it would be improper to treat migrations like these as wholly voluntary events. But here again, it doesn't feel the same, because while many people were chased out of their homes, it was a two-street that displaced people on both sides, and it was entirely chaotic mob violence (no government had a policy of making anyone leave anywhere), unlike the Israeli expuslions which were largely carried out by the Israeli military.

The closest comparison with Arabs being expelled from Israel is probably ethnic Germans fleeing or being expelled from the rest of Central Europe after World War II, affecting an estimated 12 million people between 1944 and 1950. Regardless of what we choose as our comparison, though, thats's one thought should be addressed: in all these other cases nobody else is still fighting about it today. Why would they be? If we did expel everybody from one of those cities I mentioned earlier, I'd expect the people affected to be upset, but I wouldn't expect their great-grandchildren to still be waging war over it 80 years later. How is it possible that these people haven't built new lives elsewhere in the Middle East and moved on from all this by now? The Arabs who were expelled from Israel aren't alive anymore. The Israeli leadership responsible for the expulsions aren't alive anymore either. Is it not our responsibility to try and move on, to not getting stuck in a loop fighting our ancestors' battles forever? There are many other people groups who have lived through atrocity, suffered generational trauma, had the whole history of their people forever changed, and yet they eventually make peace and coëxist with the grandchildren of those who harmed them. The way that Palestinians are currently organized is not an inevitability that arose from the Nakba. The children of oppressed people don't automatically become terrorists.

But that's supposing the oppression stops. I can make peace with the grandchildren of the population that enslaved my ancestors, but not if slavery is still ongoing and I am still a slave. And for the Arabs, the unacceptable condition, the thing they could not make peace with and tolerate, was not active military aggression, but Israel's very existence, its occupation and control of land they considered rightly theirs. The Arab world has vast resources at their disposal and could go into Palestine and build up and develop these regions, but the last thing they want is for everybody to calm down and normalize relations, because this would mean Israel got away with it. By virtue of enough time passing, the Israeli state would gain legitimacy, and the territory they're occupying would be forever theirs. This is what could not stand, and to avoid this outcome the Arab world has continuously put the conflict on hold only for long enough for somebody to fire another shot and start things up again. Palestinians were made to hold onto hope that Israel would someday be destroyed, so long as they never give up, never compromise, and just keep fighting. Vocal opposition to Israel, and pursuit of its eventual destruction, became a point of unity in the Arab world, which was often not united on much else. Throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s, the demand being made by the Arab world was not that Israel was doing some kind of military occupation they wanted to end. The demand was that Israel should not exist at all and should be completely wiped off the map.

Israel, throughout this period, was more compromising, because their goal was simply to maintain their position. I'm not going to here detail everything that happened between 1949 and today (my main interest was going over how the country came to be in 1948), but at numerous points Israelis were the ones trying to normalize relations, making international agreements, and they've agreed to withdraw from and surrender territory at numerous points (e.g. after Egypt started what's now remembered as the Six-Day War
