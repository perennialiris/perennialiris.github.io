# Israel--Palestine

||date
2025-02-13

Israel--Palestine feels like the most divisive, polarizing issue these days. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. Are you siding with the terrorists, fascists, theocrats, antisemites, the people who target civilians and use their own people as human shields? No, wait---are you siding with the apartheid state that's trying to genocide the Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor. It feels like no matter what you say, some portion of the population will end up hating you.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. It's strained some of mine. I'm willing to take that risk over certain issues, where if somebody disagrees with me I'd prefer they know. But as this topic was so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, let alone change their minds, and was not immediately relevant to my country's politics anyway (most voters didn't care much about conflicts on the other side of the world), for years my position was that it wasn't worth getting into, so I largely avoided the conversation. And this is what many people in society did as well, until the [October 7 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks) pulled the conflict back into the spotlight and made it fashionable to have a strong opinion about.

As debate about Israel--Palestine now seems unavoidable and is in the public interest (i.e. I'm now *expected*, in a way that I wasn't a few years ago, to have a clear position about it), I've here compiled my own thoughts about every aspect of the scenario I can think of. If you want to argue with me about it, you can direct me to what part of this page you disagree with.

## Terms clarification

To make this all more accessible, let's start with some maps and definitions of key terms.

||image-box
20-6.png|A quick map of the region today
20-7.png|And a more small-scale map to show Iran and Qatar

||table
**Gaza**, or the **Gaza Strip**, or **the Gaza** | the small territory in the western corner of Israel, a densely-populated area with a few major cities (the main one, in the north, is called Gaza city, and is *sometimes* also referred to simply as Gaza---pay attention for that); many of its residents are descendents of refugees displaced from Israel in the 1940s (many others went to Jordan)
**West Bank** | the larger Palestinian territory on the **east** side of Israel, so called because it's the west bank of the [Jordan River](media/20-4.png) (image link), the natural feature that separates Israel from Jordan
**Palestine**, or the **Palestinian territories** | the combination of the West Bank and Gaza ("Palestine" historically referred to the whole area, including what is now Israel, so now it just means "the part that's not Israel")
the **Golan Heights**, or the **Golan** | the region between Israel and Syria, effectively controlled by Israel (Israel annexed it in 1981); this is considered an illegal occupation; international organizations consider it an Israeli-occupied part of Syria
**Hamas** (the Islamic Resistance Movement) | this can refer to the civil government of Gaza (since 2007), but also to its affiliated militant Islamist wing; the intended meaning varies by context, though the latter use (talking about the terrorist wing) is more common
**Hezbollah** (Party of Allah) | the militant Islamist group that operates in southern Lebanon, which has infiltrated the Lebanon government and exists as a parallel force within Lebanon
the **Houthis** | the militant Islamist group that controls western Yemen
the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (the PLO), as represented by the **Palestine Authority** (or the **Palestine National Authority**) | a national coalition meant to represent the Palestinian population (founded 1964); the official representative of Palestine at the United Nations (since 1974);---it was initially labelled a terrorist group and its stated goal was the total destruction of Israel, but it became more moderate over time; the [Oslo accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords) (1993--1995) placed the Palestinian territories under control of the **Palestine Authority**, a governing body controlled by [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah), the largest party within the PLO coalition;---the Palestine Authority still controls the West Bank to this day, but notably they *lost* control of Gaza to Hamas in 2006
**IDF** | Israeli Defense Forces (the Israeli military)
**Mossad** | common name for the Israeli national intelligence agency; the name "Mossad" comes from the Hebrew word for "institution"
**Zionism** | the movement started by Jews in late-19th century Europe to create a state in the Middle East where Jewish people could be the majority and ergo have political self-determination; the name originates from Mount Zion, a location in Jerusalem, which is considered the historical home of the Jewish people

## Why care about this topic?

To talk about Israel--Palestine in a productive manner requires we not fall into accusing one another of the worst of intentions. If somebody tells me that my opposition to Israel is rooted in hating Jews---or that my support for Israel is rooted in hating Arabs---then in either case we're no longer talking about Israel--Palestine, but having a meta-conversation about my motivation to talk about it, and they're signalling they don't respect what I have to say because of my alleged motivation. I take this as an invitation to no longer engage with that person, because I don't know why they should want to talk with me anyway if that's what they believe.

It's possible for somebody who is very critical of Israel to be motivated by antisemitism, or a bias against Jewish people. They fixate on Israel, the only Jewish country, while ignoring all other wars, conflicts, and cruelty elsewhere in the world---even just elsewhere in the Arab world. They care about international law, but only when Israel is violating it. They care about genocidal and dehumanizing rhetoric, except when it's directed against Jews. They often fall into believing conspiracy theories about Jews pulling the strings in Western governments, manipulating our foreign policy, and controlling our media. They offer endless compassion and understanding for Arabs who engage in terrorism, but none at all for innocent Jews born into Israel who've known no other life than being surrounded by enemies who want them dead.

It's also possible for somebody who's very supportive of Israel to be motivated by racism and dehumanization of Arabs or Muslims. There are people who think of the Palestinians as uncivilized, scum, animals, or savages, as people who are incapable of peace, incapable of living in modern society, and ultimately as nothing more than a nuisance, and they wouldn't mind if Israel decided to wipe them out all. They act as though all Palestinians are guilty of the actions of the terrorists. They also weaponize the fact Palestinians have an Islamic culture that is repressive of homosexuality and of women's rights, as though being born into such a culture is a crime for which the Palestinians deserve some kind of cosmic punishment.

I'm wary of either possibility, and I do what I can to combat racist or dehumanizing speech in our community. When talking to people who are more supportive of Israel, I will argue if necessary that the Palestinians are unworthy of scorn or hatred, that they're our fellow human beings and how we treat people matters---including those among them who are actually in terrorist groups, which is not the majority. As I wrote in *Politics fundamentals*, a great test of your morality is how you treat somebody who's at your mercy. I likewise try to be wary about how Jewish people are treated and spoken of, which in my case---because I tend to interact with more left-wing people than right-wing these last few years---has been the greater of these two struggles.

There are legitimate reasons for a person in the West to be very critical of Israel, and even to give it far more attention than wars or conflicts elsewhere in the world. There are numerous points of entry at which a person could become acutely aware of the topic in the first place:

* We are all likely to become *aware* of Israel because our history classes teach about World War II, the Holocaust, and the League of Nations. In this way, the founding of Israel feels related to our own history, and what happens there may even feel like our fault or our responsibility, which makes it more interesting than whatever is happening in other parts of the world that feel more distant from us.
* We could hear about it each election cycle, when some of our politicians get on stage and clarify their support for Israel. I recall that in past elections here in Canada, the Conservative Party would include their support for Israel somewhere on their party platform, as one point mixed in with everything else. I don't believe any other countries were mentioned. I understand why somebody thought to include it on that page, but if I were unfamiliar with the conflict, I'd be wondering: what gives? Why are we talking about some country seemingly so far-removed from our own affairs?
 Compare: if the people in my government were all expected to have a position on what's happening in Andorra, then I would instantly want to know more about whatever's happening down there than I do now. And then if I found out the Andorran government were doing things I find gravely immoral, I might be upset that so many people in our government want to keep sending them aid.
* The Israel--Palestine conflict has also become noteworthy because of its longevity. The conflict has been going on for so long, and is so commonly seen as intractable, that for much of my life "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline, a simile for an unrealistic goal that you don't know how to achieve. This itself can make people curious: what could be so difficult about it? Why *hasn't* the world been able to get these two groups to stop fighting and killing each other after so long?
* There's been more activism on behalf of the Palestinian cause than for either side of many other issues. We could ask why that is---but we could also step back and realize it's not any one person's fault this is the case. We can't blame somebody for being more aware of Israel--Palestine than they are of the Boko Haram insurgence in Nigeria when they grew up in an environment where their peers were talking about one more than the other.

Then, once you get into Israel--Palestine, you find there's so much material, and it branches out into so many other topics, that it can easily keep you occupied for a long time. It leads to discussion and debate about the history of the region, which is told differently depending on whom you ask; to talking about imperialism and colonialism, and what obligation we have to deal with the lingering effects of past injustice; to talking about international law, the laws of armed conflict, how that's interpreted, how it should be enforced; and even to discussing fundamental questions about the very nature of a country or a national identity---what does it mean to be Palestinian? What is a valid or invalid basis on which to found a country?

## Intuitions

Let's take a few steps back. Imagine imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine and you're approaching it for the first time, intent on forming a position. You have no bias about it. You haven't been influenced to think one way or another. You're just a normal person who doesn't hate Jews or Muslims. If you started looking into the topic today, or perhaps a few years ago before the recent war escalated, what would be your initial impression? It depends. The conflict triggers various intuitions depending on who's examining it. What sort of thoughts come to mind for you? Let's consider some possibilities.

#### 1. Choose the side that does less bad stuff.

If it's a war between two sides, then maybe we should just ask which side is morally worse. If you look at Israel and then at groups like Hamas or Hezbollah, there's a lot about each of them to lead a normal person to figure Israel is less bad---perhaps not angels, but further from devils. They have a better system of government, better laws, better culture, they do better on women's rights, gay rights, religious tolerance, freedom of speech, democracy, adherence to international norms. Who would rather side with the Islamist fascists? I'd much rather live in Tel Aviv.

#### 2. Choose the side that aligns with us.

If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and wants to be our friend and is happy to work with us, and is a generally valuable asset in our broader goals in the region, then maybe we should shrug and pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is a good ally to the West, and if we decided that wasn't important anymore, it's not like we could feasibly switch sides anyway because Israel's enemies all hate us. This, realistically, it how many people are approaching the issue (including all our politicians). "Israel wants to be our friend, and the people who they're fighting hate us, ergo Israel is the side we're on; the end."

#### 3. Favour the underdog.

With great power comes great responsibility. If one side of a conflict is far more wealthy and powerful than the other, then they're the ones who are really in control, and they have a greater responsibility to act properly and direct the conflict in a moral way. In this case, Israel is holding all the cards while the Palestinians are oppressed, so if the state of things is unacceptable, then Israel is the country we should be blaming and expecting to make a change. This is another common perspective with a broad psychological appeal.

#### 4. Favour the native population.

Some people consider Israel a country of people who are foreign to the Middle East and therefore colonizers, whereas Palestinians are the native people who were there first. This means before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same piece of land, Israel has less legitimacy, and Palestinians are in the right in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as an extension of a broader Western interest in having some levers of power in the Middle East, which could be something a person opposes. (In actuality, many Israelis are not "foreigners" at all. In the early years, there were Jewish settlers from Europe who moved to Israel, but today the majority are Jews born in Israel, many of them descended from Jewish families that fled to Israel from elsewhere in the Middle East. Nonetheless, this intuition is persuasive for some people.)

#### 5. Oppose Jewish influence.

Jewish people have long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the West, there are people whose view of Israel is they're manipulators, that they attacked the USS *Liberty*, that they had something to do with 9/11, they use their control of media companies and AIPAC to control American foreign policy, they want to drag us into wars in the Middle East for their own benefit. They side against Israel in their conflict with the Arab world because they think of Israelis as nefarious Jews whom they want nothing to do with. This is more common among right-wing people, especially conspiracy theorists, though many of their memes and arguments have infected the left as well.

#### 6. Be mindful of our prejudice.

Liberal people try to be self-aware about the danger of bias and prejudice, and compensate for that in their evaluation of things. In the Israel--Palestine conflict they may see a danger of siding with Israelis because Palestinians are poorer, they're Muslims, and they're seen as less "white" than Jews (because of how European Jews are portrayed in Western media---in actuality, many Jews look more like other Middle Eastern peoples). To counteract this prejudice hazard, Jews are placed under a higher level of scrutiny, because we're trying to self-reflect and check ourselves. So in practice, this works out in the Palestinians' favour.

#### 7. Anti-American bias.

A far-left tendency is to oppose the US exerting control around the world. They criticize everything that happens in international affairs through the lens of wanting to reduce the American sphere of influence. In the Israel--Palestine conflict, they view Israel as an extension of American interests, or as a puppet of the US, being used as a divide to destabilize the Middle East for our own purposes. Israel's very existence is therefore opposed, and the countries that want to destroy Israel (including Iran) are often favoured.

Of these, which intuition(s) do you find most appealing? When I first began trying to sort out all my thoughts about this conflict, the one that affected my thinking the most was the first example I listed: "choose the side that does less bad stuff". That's just part of how I navigate conflicts. If you were to tell me a war just broke out between two factions in any other random country on the planet and I had to take a side, I would start by asking which faction is less evil.

In applying that lens to Israel--Palestine, I made the following observations:

* Israel's government is something like a middling European democracy---flawed, but aspiring in the right direction. They have freedom of speech, they allow vocal criticism of the government, you're allowed to form opposition parties and vote the current government out of power. Their military is also held to a far higher standard than any other in the region. There are some problematic aspects of Israeli society, but in terms of its overall character, it's far less oppressive than average for this part of the world.
* The terrorist groups Israel is at war with aren't seeking freedom; they're basically fascists. They want to implement an authoritarian, theocratic society powered by radical Islam. And in their fight to destroy Israel, they have virtually no ethics, they have no respect for international law, they have no regard for civilian deaths, no, all bets are off, they're willing to do anything it takes to win. This is not a normal "resistance movement", it's a resistance movement that's been hijacked by crazy people.
* Hamas and other Islamist groups openly proclaim their goal is not ending the occupation of Palestine, but the eradication of Jews and the complete destruction of Israeli society. They say not death to Israelis, but death to the Jews---and that's not a mistake; they're well aware of the distinction. They aren't against Arab Israelis, and non-Israeli Jews don't get a pass. If they got their way, they would carry out a second Holocaust.

For me, this formed a reasonable basis for leaning toward support for Israel, but I still had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort to brutality *after decades of injustice* cancel out that initial injustice? No. If Israel is imposing unjust conditions onto the Palestinians, then any intuition about Israel seeming to operate in a more moral way in the present can't be the end of the story.

If you aren't sure what I mean, imagine a slave society where some people are owned as property. A group of rebel slaves break free and rampage through the streets. They kill whole families, they rape women, they laugh while doing it. I could say these rebels had done something immoral, and that would be true---but their actions being immoral doesn't speak to whether the conditions of slavery were justified to begin with. It would be a mistake to let that distract me from also condemning the latter, which is actually the far greater crime overall.

An immoral thing can appear better than it is when it becomes part of a system that legitimizes it through rules and procedure, and people grow used to it over time. What if the system itself is evil? What if we've grown accustomed to evil? This is what the Palestinian cause demands we investigate. Is there something abhorrent and unacceptable about the status quo, like slavery, that Palestinians are forced to endure, and which it would be wrong of us to overlook while condemning the latest Hamas attack?

## The Israeli perspective

The Jews were effectively a powerless, persecuted minority, constantly scapegoated and discriminated against, and now they were the primary targets of one of the most terrible genocides of all time. And even after having just liberated them from the Nazis, many of the most powerful Western countries didn't care about the Jews. Jewish refugees were turned away, rejected, and continued to be treated badly. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. How could they? So they came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance, to create their own space where they could be safe and have autonomy instead of being forever at the mercy of the ruling majority population of other countries. Predictably they were attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who would prefer to wipe them all out.

20-5.png|Israel, surrounded in the Arab world|Israel, surrounded in the Arab world

Today the 'underdog' mentality benefits the Palestinians, but in the past it more benefited Israel. Look at them on a map, surrounded by much larger enemies with bigger populations. And Israel didn't used to have the technological or economic advantages it has today. For decades, Israel was the underdog in the Middle East---and much of that time was during the Cold War, when the entire world was fighting over democracy versus Communism. They were on our side, the only democracy in the Middle East, while many of the Arabs associated with the Soviets. Their victories felt like our victories. That's how people who remember those years largely feel about it. They went to war against Hezbollah and Hamas, they came out ahead, then we took down the Berlin Wall, and it all blurs together in the collective memory as a time that it kicked ass to be American.

Then 9/11 happened. The public was psychologically unprepared for the trauma this would apparently inflict upon them. This firmly secured that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, the Muslims are the ones who aren't on our side, meaning the Jews are the ones who are, because the enemy of my enemy and all that. But if you were born in the late 90s or later, you might barely remember 9/11, not remember the Cold War at all, and none of this really means anything to you. For you, Israel is just some country somewhere that all your politicians weirdly feel the need to mention, and then you hear on the news that they're doing apartheid and racism and ethnic cleansing, and you're like, hey, wait, isn't this terrible? There's a significant generational difference in information and perspective.

Israelis view theirselves as being surrounded by big enemies, and having a history of fighting big enemies. They think they're the little guy. But when people in the West today look at Israel, they only compare Israel to Palestine. They look at Israeli soliders, then they look at where people in Gaza live. The frame has shifted in such a way that Israel is now viewed as the oppressor bullying the little guy. This shift happened partly because of deliberate media tactics by Israel's critics, but also due to actually changing circumstances. Which framing is more accurate?

To get a feel for things like that, we have to back at least a century or so.

## Terrorism isn't unique to any population

If the region where I live were annexed by some other country and we were occupied---or ruled over by a neighbouring state that freely entered our territory at will in a manner that was very close to if not technically an occupation---for a long period of time, and all of us opposed this and wanted it to stop but couldn't overpower this enemy through conventional means and they were unwilling to cede control to us, then my expectation is that my people would eventually become terrorists, for lack of better word. Some of them, anyway. Not all of us, not a majority, but some of us. Enough of us that it would pose a problem.

I'm not describing this as good or bad. I'm sure one could argue that the potential for some humans to do bad things has good side-effects in preventing us from being too easily ruled over. The point is only to say that in any large population, you can expect there to be a diverse range of psychologies, including people who are more willing than average to engage in what I consider terrible actions, especially when they feel their cause is righteous and desperate and rooted in self-defense against an evil enemy.

On a similar note: in Nazi Germany, who do you think guarded all the extermination camps? They didn't have to breed those Germans in a lab. They already existed among the population. If a dictatorship arose in any given country, there's going to be some percentage of people who come to support it. And if your country *doesn't* fall to dictatorship, those people would probably just carry on living normal lives, their potential for horrific action never being realized or utilized. They exist among us. Their psychotic nature requires a certain environment to activate it. I sometimes encounter people whom I think this about: "If we lived in Nazi Germany, this guy would've been fine standing guard at Dachau." Haven't you ever met anyone like that? Not that he's going to be a serial killer in this life, but that if the stars aligned and he was called to action, he'd shrug and pull the trigger.

So it's important, when judging another population, to remember that our potential to do horrific things has not gone away either. We just live in different circumstances and as such that potential is typically not unlocked. We've created peaceful, orderly societies, but we're not inherently special or better in that way. If our societies collapsed, some of us would become terrorists too. There are people in Gaza today who were born there while it was occupied by Israel, and then people who were born after Israel stopped occupying it directly, but while it's still under blockade with a militarized border and periodic visits by Israeli militants. And they grow up listening to stories from their elders about how this all came to be. In the West Bank, people are born into a circumstance where they're relatively poor and unsafe, but soldiers from a more powerful country to the west of them occasionally come in and act like they run the place. For most of us in the West, we can only imagine what this feels like. And this is the only world they've ever known.

Then, down the street, there's a man who offers them a chance to join the fight, to actually do something and strike back against the source of all their problems. *Of course* many of them are interested. And if we agreed with their cause, we would characterize this as the more heroic path, at least at first.

This is where some people don't agree when I say Hamas does more immoral things than Israel. They view Israel's very existence, or the existence of the blockade, or Israel's military occupation in the West Bank, to be evil (which thing they focus on depends in the person). Hamas is like the rebel slave, reacting to Israeli oppression. The observation that Hamas does wicked things as part of their fight doesn't speak to whether Israel's actions are justified to begin with. This is why you can't avoid getting into the history of everything.

Be careful not to fall too hard in the other direction either, though. Just because you're a victim doesn't mean you can't also be a villain. Maybe that guy who beats his wife was bullied as a child. Everybody has a story for why they are the way they are. We can't act like people have no responsibility for their actions just because something bad happened to them. The Nazis had a story of how they had been pushed around and beaten on, too. Feeling like you're the underdog and ergo you have license to break the rules and pursue vengeance can be a powerful tool in service of evil.

How did we get here? First, I want to ask: how did it come to be that a majority of people in the West support Israel, anyway? Let's consider the early Israeli narrative, and the history that led up to Israel's founding.

## The history of the conflict

Even before Nazi Germany, Jews were mistreated in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904) founded modern Zionism by proposing that Jews should unite and form a state of their own, because they could never truly feel secure as a minority in Christian Europe, where Jews were forever considered aliens and outsiders and were occasionally massacred in pogroms that destroyed their communities. The case for Herzl's proposal would only become stronger in the decades after his death.

20-1.png|The Ottoman Empire in 1914 (modern borders faded)

As a consequence of the events of World War I (1914--1918), the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled a large part of the Middle East from its capital in Constantinople, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides of the war, and Britain sought to destabilize them by supporting Arab revolts against Ottoman rule, first unsuccessfully in 1916. The following year, with WWI still ongoing, Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary and former Prime Minister, declared that after the war, Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in a region called Palestine, then under Ottoman rule, where there was already a Jewish population. His letter of support is now known as the **Balfour declaration**.

A year before the Balfour declaration, Britain was making promises to Arab leaders, who were taking great risk in revolting against the Ottomans. In exchange for their participation, Britain agreed to recognize Arab independence after the war. This traces back to a series of communications in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahon–Hussein correspondence**. 'Hussein' refers to Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi (1854--1931), the Sharif of Mecca who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. (He detested the Balfour declaration and refused to work with the British after the war, now more independent as the King of Hejaz, a new country ruling over the western strip of the Arabian peninsula that used to be Ottoman territory. This led the British to support Ibn Saud, who in 1925 conquered Hejaz and took Mecca, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia.)

||image-float
20-8.png|The Sykes--Picot Agreement

The British also made a secret agreement with the French in 1916, called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement**, to partition the Ottoman territory in the Levant (between Turkey and Saudi Arabia) after the war, with Britain taking the southern part and France the north. Palestine became known as **Mandatory Palestine**, and was a region on the western end of the British side of the partition, ergo it was the British whom Jews had to work with to control the area.

Allied forces then occupied Constantinople, which started the **Turkish War of Independence**, where Turkish Nationalists fought to repel them from the country and establish the modern republic of Turkey. I mention this to further emphasize how much in the world was changing around this period. Countries were rising and falling, borders shifting, millions of people were migrating. In the interwar period, Jewish people started migrating to the region, settling new towns, developing farmland---but this led to conflict with the Arab population in the area. The British at some point limited how many Jews were allowed to migrate to the region because they noticed it was causing conflict. Though Jewish people always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to them was exacerbated at the time by the perception they were Europeans, foreigners coming into the region from abroad. That perception lingers to this day.

20-2.png|A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region, not carelessly in half but with some respect to the existing demography and sociological boundaries. They wanted to allow Jews to have a majority in the region allotted to them so they could be an independent community rather than be ruled by a Muslim majority, per the wishes of the whole movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would have ended up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' side would only have remained majority Jewish by a few percentage points. In other words, they put as many Muslims as possible into the Jewish community without going over, then gave the rest of the land to the Muslims as well.
