# Israel--Palestine

\<div class="alert"> I’m still in the process of re-writing this page. I removed the previous version. The content on this page currently is what it’s been replaced with so far.</div>

Israel--Palestine feels like the most divisive, polarizing issue these days. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. Are you siding with the terrorists, fascists, theocrats, antisemites, the people who target civilians and use their own people as human shields? No, wait---are you siding with the apartheid state that's trying to genocide the Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor. It feels like no matter what you say, some portion of the population will end up hating you.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. It's strained some of mine. I'm willing to take that risk over certain issues, where if somebody disagrees with me I'd prefer they know. But as this topic was so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, let alone change their minds, and was not immediately relevant to my country's politics anyway (most voters didn't care much about conflicts on the other side of the world), for years my position was that it wasn't worth getting into, so I largely avoided the conversation. And this is what many people in society did as well, until the [October 7 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks) pulled the conflict back into the spotlight and made it fashionable to have a strong opinion about.

As debate about Israel--Palestine now seems unavoidable and is in the public interest (i.e. I'm now *expected*, in a way that I wasn't a few years ago, to have a clear position about it), I've here compiled my own thoughts about every aspect of the scenario I can think of. If you want to argue with me about it, you can direct me to what part of this page you disagree with.

## Terms clarification

To make this all more accessible, let's start with some maps and definitions of key terms.

||image-box
20-6.png|A quick map of the region today
20-7.png|And a more small-scale map to show Iran and Qatar

||table
**Gaza**, or the **Gaza Strip**, or **the Gaza** | the small territory in the western corner of Israel, a densely-populated area with a few major cities (the main one, in the north, is called Gaza city, and is *sometimes* also referred to simply as Gaza---pay attention for that); many of its residents are descendents of refugees displaced from Israel in the 1940s (many others went to Jordan)
**West Bank** | the larger Palestinian territory on the **east** side of Israel, so called because it's the west bank of the [Jordan River](media/20-4.png) (image link), the natural feature that separates Israel from Jordan
**Palestine**, or the **Palestinian territories** | the combination of the West Bank and Gaza ("Palestine" historically referred to the whole area, including what is now Israel, so now it just means "the part that's not Israel")
the **Golan Heights**, or the **Golan** | the region between Israel and Syria, effectively controlled by Israel (Israel annexed it in 1981); this is considered an illegal occupation; international organizations consider it an Israeli-occupied part of Syria
**Hamas** (the Islamic Resistance Movement) | this can refer to the civil government of Gaza (since 2007), but also to its affiliated militant Islamist wing; the intended meaning varies by context, though the latter use (talking about the terrorist wing) is more common
**Hezbollah** (Party of Allah) | the militant Islamist group that operates in southern Lebanon, which has infiltrated the Lebanon government and exists as a parallel force within Lebanon
the **Houthis** | the militant Islamist group that controls western Yemen
the **Palestine Liberation Organization** (the PLO), as represented by the **Palestine Authority** (or the **Palestine National Authority**) | a national coalition meant to represent the Palestinian population (founded 1964); the official representative of Palestine at the United Nations (since 1974);---it was initially labelled a terrorist group and its stated goal was the total destruction of Israel, but it became more moderate over time; the [Oslo accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords) (1993--1995) placed the Palestinian territories under control of the **Palestine Authority**, a governing body controlled by [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah), the largest party within the PLO coalition;---the Palestine Authority still controls the West Bank to this day, but notably they *lost* control of Gaza to Hamas in 2006
**IDF** | Israeli Defense Forces (the Israeli military)
**Mossad** | common name for the Israeli national intelligence agency; derived from the Hebrew for *institution*
**Zionism** | the movement started by Jews in late-19th century Europe to create a state in the Middle East where Jewish people could be the majority and ergo have political self-determination; the name originates from Mount Zion, a location in Jerusalem, which is considered the historical home of the Jewish people

## Why care about this topic?

To talk about Israel--Palestine in a productive manner requires we not fall into accusing one another of the worst of intentions. If somebody tells me that my opposition to Israel is rooted in hating Jews---or that my support for Israel is rooted in hating Arabs---then in either case we're no longer talking about Israel--Palestine, but having a meta-conversation about my motivation to talk about it, and they're signalling they don't respect what I have to say because of my alleged motivation. I take this as an invitation to no longer engage with that person, because I don't know why they should want to talk with me anyway if that's what they believe.

It's possible for somebody who is very critical of Israel to be motivated by antisemitism, or a bias against Jewish people. They fixate on Israel, the only Jewish country, while ignoring all other wars, conflicts, and cruelty elsewhere in the world---even just elsewhere in the Arab world. They care about international law, but only when Israel is violating it. They care about genocidal and dehumanizing rhetoric, except when it's directed against Jews. They often fall into believing conspiracy theories about Jews pulling the strings in Western governments, manipulating our foreign policy, and controlling our media. They offer endless compassion and understanding for Arabs who engage in terrorism, but none at all for innocent Jews born into Israel who've known no other life than being surrounded by enemies who want them dead.

It's also possible for somebody who's very supportive of Israel to be motivated by racism and dehumanization of Arabs or Muslims. There are people who think of the Palestinians as uncivilized, scum, animals, or savages, as people who are incapable of peace, incapable of living in modern society, and ultimately as nothing more than a nuisance, and they wouldn't mind if Israel decided to wipe them out all. They act as though all Palestinians are guilty of the actions of the terrorists. They also weaponize the fact Palestinians have an Islamic culture that is repressive of homosexuality and of women's rights, as though being born into such a culture is a crime for which the Palestinians deserve some kind of cosmic punishment.

I'm wary of either possibility, and I do what I can to combat racist or dehumanizing speech in our community. When talking to people who are more supportive of Israel, I will argue if necessary that the Palestinians are unworthy of scorn or hatred, that they're our fellow human beings and how we treat people matters---including those among them who are actually in terrorist groups, which is not the majority. As I wrote in *Politics fundamentals*, a great test of your morality is how you treat somebody who's at your mercy. I likewise try to be wary about how Jewish people are treated and spoken of, which in my case---because I tend to interact with more left-wing people than right-wing these last few years---has been the greater of these two struggles.

There are legitimate reasons for a person in the West to be very critical of Israel, and even to give it far more attention than wars or conflicts elsewhere in the world. There are numerous points of entry at which a person could become acutely aware of the topic in the first place:

* We are all likely to become *aware* of Israel because our history classes teach about World War II, the Holocaust, and the League of Nations. In this way, the founding of Israel feels related to our own history, and what happens there may even feel like our fault or our responsibility, which makes it more interesting than whatever is happening in other parts of the world that feel more distant from us.
* We could hear about it each election cycle, when some of our politicians get on stage and clarify their support for Israel. I recall that in past elections here in Canada, the Conservative Party would include their support for Israel somewhere on their party platform, as one point mixed in with everything else. I don't believe any other countries were mentioned. I understand why somebody thought to include it on that page, but if I were unfamiliar with the conflict, I'd be wondering: what gives? Why are we talking about some country seemingly so far-removed from our own affairs?
 Compare: if the people in my government were all expected to have a position on what's happening in Andorra, then I would instantly want to know more about whatever's happening down there than I do now. And then if I found out the Andorran government were doing things I find gravely immoral, I might be upset that so many people in our government want to keep sending them aid.
* The Israel--Palestine conflict has also become noteworthy because of its longevity. The conflict has been going on for so long, and is so commonly seen as intractable, that for much of my life "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline, a simile for an unrealistic goal that you don't know how to achieve. This itself can make people curious: what could be so difficult about it? Why *hasn't* the world been able to get these two groups to stop fighting and killing each other after so long?
* There's been more activism on behalf of the Palestinian cause than for either side of many other issues. We could ask why that is---but we could also step back and realize it's not any one person's fault this is the case. We can't blame somebody for being more aware of Israel--Palestine than they are of the Boko Haram insurgence in Nigeria when they grew up in an environment where their peers were talking about one more than the other.

Then, once you get into Israel--Palestine, you find there's so much material, and it branches out into so many other topics, that it can easily keep you occupied for a long time. It leads to discussion and debate about the history of the region, which is told differently depending on whom you ask; to talking about imperialism and colonialism, and what obligation we have to deal with the lingering effects of past injustice; to talking about international law, the laws of armed conflict, how that's interpreted, how it should be enforced; and even to discussing fundamental questions about the very nature of a country or a national identity---what does it mean to be Palestinian? What is a valid or invalid basis on which to found a country?

## Intuitions

Let's take a few steps back. Imagine imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine and you're approaching it for the first time, intent on forming a position. You have no bias about it. You haven't been influenced to think one way or another. You're just a normal person who doesn't hate Jews or Muslims. If you started looking into the topic today, or perhaps a few years ago before the recent war escalated, what would be your initial impression? It depends. The conflict triggers various intuitions depending on who's examining it. What sort of thoughts come to mind for you? Let's consider some possibilities.

#### 1. Choose the side that does less bad stuff.

If it's a war between two sides, then maybe we should just ask which side is morally worse. If you look at Israel and then at groups like Hamas or Hezbollah, there's a lot about each of them to lead a normal person to figure Israel is less bad---perhaps not angels, but further from devils. They have a better system of government, better laws, better culture, they do better on women's rights, gay rights, religious tolerance, freedom of speech, democracy, adherence to international norms. Who would rather side with the Islamist fascists? I'd much rather live in Tel Aviv.

#### 2. Choose the side that aligns with us.

If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and wants to be our friend and is happy to work with us, and is a generally valuable asset in our broader goals in the region, then maybe we should shrug and pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is a good ally to the West, and if we decided that wasn't important anymore, it's not like we could feasibly switch sides anyway because Israel's enemies all hate us. This, realistically, it how many people are approaching the issue (including all our politicians). "Israel wants to be our friend, and the people who they're fighting hate us, ergo Israel is the side we're on; the end."

#### 3. Favour the underdog.

With great power comes great responsibility. If one side of a conflict is far more wealthy and powerful than the other, then they're the ones who are really in control, and they have a greater responsibility to act properly and direct the conflict in a moral way. In this case, Israel is holding all the cards while the Palestinians are oppressed, so if the state of things is unacceptable, then Israel is the country we should be blaming and expecting to make a change. This is another common perspective with a broad psychological appeal.

#### 4. Favour the native population.

Some people consider Israel a country of people who are foreign to the Middle East and therefore colonizers, whereas Palestinians are the native people who were there first. This means before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same piece of land, Israel has less legitimacy, and Palestinians are in the right in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as an extension of a broader Western interest in having some levers of power in the Middle East, which could be something a person opposes. (In actuality, many Israelis are not "foreigners" at all. In the early years, there were Jewish settlers from Europe who moved to Israel, but today the majority are Jews born in Israel, many of them descended from Jewish families that fled to Israel from elsewhere in the Middle East. Nonetheless, this intuition is persuasive for some people.)

#### 5. Oppose Jewish influence.

Jewish people have long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the West, there are people whose view of Israel is they're manipulators, that they attacked the USS *Liberty*, that they had something to do with 9/11, they use their control of media companies and AIPAC to control American foreign policy, they want to drag us into wars in the Middle East for their own benefit. They side against Israel in their conflict with the Arab world because they think of Israelis as nefarious Jews whom they want nothing to do with. This is more common among right-wing people, especially conspiracy theorists, though many of their memes and arguments have infected the left as well.

#### 6. Be mindful of our prejudice.

Liberal people try to be self-aware about the danger of bias and prejudice, and compensate for that in their evaluation of things. In the Israel--Palestine conflict they may see a danger of siding with Israelis because Palestinians are poorer, they're Muslims, and they're seen as less "white" than Jews (because of how European Jews are portrayed in Western media---in actuality, many Jews look more like other Middle Eastern peoples). To counteract this prejudice hazard, Jews are placed under a higher level of scrutiny, because we're trying to self-reflect and check ourselves. So in practice, this works out in the Palestinians' favour.

#### 7. Anti-American bias.

A far-left tendency is to oppose the US exerting control around the world. They criticize everything that happens in international affairs through the lens of wanting to reduce the American sphere of influence. In the Israel--Palestine conflict, they view Israel as an extension of American interests, or as a puppet of the US, being used as a divide to destabilize the Middle East for our own purposes. Israel's very existence is therefore opposed, and the countries that want to destroy Israel (including Iran) are often favoured.

Of these, which intuition(s) do you find most appealing? When I first began trying to sort out all my thoughts about this conflict, the one that affected my thinking the most was the first example I listed: "choose the side that does less bad stuff". That's just part of how I navigate conflicts. If you were to tell me a war just broke out between two factions in any other random country on the planet and I had to take a side, I would start by asking which faction is less evil.

In applying that lens to Israel--Palestine, I made the following observations:

* Israel's government is something like a middling European democracy---flawed, but aspiring in the right direction. They have freedom of speech, they allow vocal criticism of the government, you're allowed to form opposition parties and vote the current government out of power. Their military is also held to a far higher standard than any other in the region. There are some problematic aspects of Israeli society, but in terms of its overall character, it's far less oppressive than average for this part of the world.
* The terrorist groups Israel is at war with aren't seeking freedom; they're basically fascists. They want to implement an authoritarian, theocratic society powered by radical Islam. And in their fight to destroy Israel, they have virtually no ethics, they have no respect for international law, they have no regard for civilian deaths, no, all bets are off, they're willing to do anything it takes to win. This is not a normal "resistance movement", it's a resistance movement that's been hijacked by crazy people.
* Hamas and other Islamist groups openly proclaim their goal is not ending the occupation of Palestine, but the eradication of Jews and the complete destruction of Israeli society. They say not death to Israelis, but death to the Jews---and that's not a mistake; they're well aware of the distinction. They aren't against Arab Israelis, and non-Israeli Jews don't get a pass. If they got their way, they would carry out a second Holocaust.

For me, this formed a reasonable basis for leaning toward support for Israel, but I still had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort to brutality *after decades of injustice* cancel out that initial injustice? No. If Israel is imposing unjust conditions onto the Palestinians, then any intuition about Israel seeming to operate in a more moral way in the present can't be the end of the story.

If you aren't sure what I mean, imagine a slave society where some people are owned as property. A group of rebel slaves break free and rampage through the streets. They kill whole families, they rape women, they laugh while doing it. I could say these rebels had done something immoral, and that would be true---but their actions being immoral doesn't speak to whether the conditions of slavery were justified to begin with. It would be a mistake to let that distract me from also condemning the latter, which is actually the far greater crime overall.

An immoral thing can appear better than it is when it becomes part of a system that legitimizes it through rules and procedure, and people grow used to it over time. What if the system itself is evil? What if we've grown accustomed to evil? This is what the Palestinian cause demands we investigate. Is there something abhorrent and unacceptable about the status quo, like slavery, that Palestinians are forced to endure, and which it would be wrong of us to overlook while condemning the latest Hamas attack?

To answer that, you have to examine the history of the conflict.

## The history of the conflict

### Background

Even before Nazi Germany, Jews were mistreated in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904), a Jewish man born in what is today Budapest, founded modern **Zionism** by proposing (in 1895) that Jews should unite and form a state of their own, rather than try to assimilate to their host nations, as many Jews were then attempting. Herzl said Jews could never truly feel secure living as a minority in Christian Europe, where Jews were, despite their best efforts, forever victims of antisemitism, treated with suspicion, called aliens and outsiders, used as scapegoats, and periodically massacred in pogroms that destroyed whole Jewish communities. It was just one tragedy after another going back centuries. The movement Herzl started lived on in the decades after his early death, and the case for his proposal would only become stronger as events unfolded.

The movement was named after Zion, or Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem (in modern English, "mount" is often associated with mountains, but it used to just mean any elevated ground) mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, but also used poetically as a metonym for Jerusalem itself, and in some cases for all of Israel. The name signified the belief that if Jewish people were to have a homeland, it ought to be in the place their people were from historically, which was, indisputably, the region of Palestine, in the ancient Jewish kingdoms of Israel and Judea, where Soloman's Temple was built in 957 BC to house the Ark of the Covenant. Their whole society was destroyed and they were exiled from the land.

20-1.png|The Ottoman Empire in 1914 (modern borders faded)

As a consequence of the events of **World War I** (1914--1918), the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled a large part of the Middle East from its capital in Constantinople, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides of the war, and Britain sought to destabilize them by supporting Arab revolts against Ottoman rule. The following year, with WWI still ongoing, Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary and former Prime Minister, declared that after the war Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in a region called Palestine, then under Ottoman control. His letter of support is now known as the **Balfour declaration**. It was deliberately vague, not defining its terms or specifying an exact location, size, or boundaries.

There were already problems. A year before the Balfour declaration, Britain made promises to Arab leaders to recognize Arab independence after the war---though, like the Balfour declaration, their promises weren't very specific. This traces back to a series of letters in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahon--Hussein correspondence**, between British diplomat Henry McMahon and Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi (1854--1931), the Sharif of Makkah who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. A proponent of pan-Arabism (a desire for political unity among Arab nations), Hussein declared himself Caliph after the war, but detested the Balfour declaration and refused to coöperate with the British (e.g. he refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles). This eventually led to the British supporting Ibn Saud, who in 1925 conquered Hejaz and took Makkah, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia. (The Muslim holy city is still commonly known as *Mecca* throughout the English world, but the official spelling has been *Makkah* since the Saudi government sought to standardize Arabic--English transliteration.)

||image-float
20-8.png|The Sykes--Picot Agreement

Britain also made a secret agreement with France in 1916 called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement** to partition their control of Ottoman territory in the Levant after the war, with Britain taking the southern part and France the north. Palestine was on the western end of the British side of the partition, ergo it was the British whom Jews had to work with and appeal to. The UN would later (in 1920) give Britain an explicit mandate to control Palestine until it could become self-governing, and it became known as **Mandatory Palestine** while under British control.

After WWI, the Ottoman empire had lost its Arabian territories and was in a state of near-collapse, its power mostly limited to the Anatolian plateau around Constantinople, and the Allies were trying to prosecute members of the Ottoman government for their role in the Armenian genocide (1915--17). The Ottoman Sultan who ruled throughout most of WWI, Mehmed V, had just died shortly before the end of the war, and his half-brother, Mehmed VI, inherited the situation. The little power he had was then challenged by the rising Turkish Nationalist movement, led by Atatürk, the man himself. Allied forces then occupied Constantinople, and so began the **Turkish War of Independence** (1919--23), in which Turkish Nationalists fought to repel the Allies from the country, formally ended the Ottoman Empire (1922), and established the modern republic of Turkey (1923). (Constantinople was officially renamed to Istanbul in 1930.)

A lot was changing in the world. Countries were rising and falling, borders being redrawn, and in the background, millions of normal people were picking up their lives and migrating to avoid conflict and to be part of the communities of their choice. In the interwar period (1918--39), tens of thousands of Jewish people continued migrating into Mandatory Palestine, settling new towns, developing farmland, but also leading to conflict and tension with the Arab population in that area. The British even limited how many Jews were allowed to migrate to the region in the 20s because they noticed it was leading to problems, and it was still their responsibility to keep the peace. Though some Jewish people had always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to them at this time was exacerbated by the perception they were Europeans, foreigners coming into the region from abroad---a tragically ironic fate for the Jews, considered aliens both in Europe and in the Levant. (In the following decades, many Jews throughout the rest of the Middle East would flee persecution to Israel, and so Israel became less 'European' the more time went by.)

20-2.png|UN Res. 181 (passed 1947)|A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region---not carelessly in half, but with respect to the existing population and its demography while trying to create a Jewish-majority region per the wishes of the Zionist movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would end up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' would've been only barely majority-Jewish. In other words, they put as many Muslims as possible into the Jewish side without going over half, then gave the rest to Muslims as well. On the other hand, this resulted in the Jewish side having more land per person.

Arabs viewed the partition plan as unfairly benefitting the Jews. They boycotted participation in the negotiations, and refused to accept any partition plan proposed. The UN passed the resolution anyway, and fighting between Jews and Muslims broke out across the country (1948 Palestine war), but British forces did little to intervene and simply began withdrawing from the region, leaving everybody to fend for theirselves. In 1948, just as the British Mandate officially ended, the newly constituted State of Israel declared its independence, and both sides prepared for war. The armies of all surrounding Arab countries---Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen---would invaded the region (1948 Israel--Palestine war), but Israel fought back and somehow held its own, leading to a stalemate in 1949, and then to all countries involved signing an armistice agreement in 1949. The armistice lines (where the armies on both sides were pushed up to when the fighting stopped) became the de facto borders of Israel for the next few decades. Notably, the city of Jerusalem was cut in half, with Israel controlling the west and Jordan controlling the east. (There's an interesting parallel with Berlin here.)

For Israelis, this was a victory. They had to fight for it, lives were lost, and they didn't get all the territory they hoped for, but they finally had a country to call their own. It was even in their ancestral homeland, where they had access to historical religious sites, including the literal hill they call 'Mount Zion' (though the Temple Mount, site of the first temple built by King Soloman, considered the holiest site in Judaism, remained under Jordan's control in East Jerusalem until 1967).

However, as part of the fighting in the first part of the 1948 war, Israeli forces attacked Muslim Arabs all across the territory they controlled, and hundreds of Palestinian villages were looted and destroyed. In total, by the end of it, around 700,000 Arabs had fled or were directly expelled, most of them going to the remaining Palestinian territories then controlled by Egypt and Jordan, where they built new lives as refugees. Arabs today refer to this year of violent displacement as **the Nakba** (Arabic for *catastrophe*), which became the uniting story of Palestinian identity.

### The pro-Israeli, Western perspective

Why have so many people in the West been pro-Israel for so long? A big part of it is they had a compelling, heroiic narrative. The Jews were a powerless, persecuted minority, victims of the most terrible genocide of all time. Even after liberating them from the Nazis, many powerful Western countries didn't care about them. Jewish refugees were turned away, rejected, and continued to be treated badly. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. How could they? So they united, they came together in solidarity and resistance, and the created their own space where they could feel safe and have autonomy. They were attacked, but they persevered and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who wanted them all dead. It was glorious, the ultimate comeback story.

Today, the underdog mentality benefits Palestinians, but during the Cold War, it played for Israel. Just look at them on a map, surrounded by larger countries with bigger populations. Israel was the underdog in the Middle East. And while the rest of the world was fighting for democracy against the threat of Communism, Israel was on our side. They were the only democracy in the Middle East, while significant parts of the Arab world, like Egypt and Syria, were allied with the Soviets. The USSR distributed anti-Zionist propaganda depicting the Jews as puppets of the US, and supported the Palestinian cause, especially into the 1970s when both the US and USSR became more directly invested in the conflict.

Israel's victories felt like our victories. They were our friend, beating up our enemies. That's how it felt for people alive at the time. And then Reagan told Gorbachev to tear down that wall, everybody clapped, the USSR fell apart, the American space program put a man on the moon, there was Elvis, Michael Jackson, rock and roll, Sunday morning football, a good paying job down at the plant, and it all blurs together into this collective memory a time when it kicked ass to be American. Then 9/11 happened. The American public was completely unprepared for the trauma that having a foreign enemy attack them on their own territory would inflict. Suddenly everybody realized there was a group of people called Muslims, and they didn't like them or want to see them on airplanes. The lesson was that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, Muslims were the ones who hated you and burned the American flag, so apparently Jews are on our side, becausea enemy of my enemy and all that.

But now we're getting into a generational divide. If you were born in the late 90s or onward, you might barely remember 9/11 or what the world was like before it. For you, Israel was just some country on the other side of the world that all your politicians felt the need to mention when trying to get your parents to vote for them, and then you looked it up and learned it was doing some bad stuff. Israel is now wealthy and powerful, and the big countries they're surrounded by aren't really enemies anymore. Now they're just fighting small militias along its border. They're not the underdogs anymore. We see footage of Israeli soldiers, and we look at the neighbourhoods in Gaza, and suddenly it feels like Israel is the oppressor bullying the little guys. The fight has been reframed from "Israel vs. all the Arab countries" to just "Israel vs. the Palestinians", and now the Palestinians are the underdogs.

### The Arab perspective

20-9.png|Location of Makkah in pre-WWI Ottoman Empire
20-10.png|The Kaaba in Makkah

In Western Arabia, along the eastern coast of the Red Sea, there is **Makkah**, the holiest city in Islam, birthplace of the prophet Muhammad, and location of the Kaaba, the cube-shaped Mosque that millions of Muslims make a pilgrimage to visit each year, and in whose direction all Muslims around the world face daily in prayer. For centuries, Makkah was controlled by the (non-Arab) Ottoman Empire, though often through a vassal-state called the Sharifate of Makkah. (A Sharifate means rule by a *Sharif*, a person who claims to be descended from the prophet Muhammad's grandson.)

In 1908, the Young Turk Revolution resulted in a party called the **Committee of Union and Progress** gaining significant power within the Ottoman Empire, existing alongside the Sultan. That same year, the Ottoman sultan appointed **Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi** to be the new Sharif of Makkah. Hussein grew critical of the Ottoman Empire, as he believed the government had usurped too much power from the sultan, and they were persecuting non-Turkish minorities. Hussein helped save thousands of Armenians during the Armenian genocide, and then, when the time was right, in 1916 he launched the **Great Arab Revolt** against the Ottomans (after the McMahon--Hussein correspondence). After the Ottoman Empire had been formally dissolved, Hussein declared himself the new Caliph in 1924. (A Caliph is a Muslim ruler who claims to be the successor to the prophet Muhammad, and therefore implicit leader of the entire Muslim world.) Though he was forced to abdicate from his position in Makkah the following year after being attacked by Ibn Saud, which is why Saudi Arabia controls Makkah today, Hussein still had a significant influence as the "father of pan-Arabism", and his sons became the kings of Iraq (Faisal I, r. 1921--33) and Jordan (Abdullah I, r. 1921--51).

20-11.png|The Israel proposal, cutting the Arab world in half

Not all Arab states were immediately advocates of pan-Arabism (as in forming a singular Arab super-country), but Arab unity, and a rejection of influence in the Arab world by Western powers, was in the air. Arab leaders felt betrayed by the West after, instead of leaving and allowing the region to be controlled by the Arab forces that had just helped them overthrow the Ottomans and win their war, Britain was already planning, in secrecy, before the Ottomans had even fallen, to install a Jewish state, populated by tens of thousands of settlers from Europe, right in the heart of the Middle East, in the centre of everything, and the United Nations helped facilitate it. They even proposed its borders would stretch all the way down to the Gulf of Aqaba, meaning you couldn't move between the Sinai and Arabia without going through Israeli territory. Muslims in Egypt, then the most powerful Arab country, would no longer be able to travel to Makkah by land without the Jews' permission. Israel, as the United Nations proposed, was like a dagger used to cut the Arab world in half.

From the Arab perspective, the whole situation was already objectionable before any fighting started. The creation of Israel, in that location, with those borders, without any Arab states being consulted? Then, when Jewish militants began attacking the Muslim community in Palestine (in 1948), and expelling thousands from their homes, creating a refugee crisis in the region, the Arab powers knew they had to react. This couldn't go on. A few years prior, in 1945, the **Arab League** had been formed, headquartered in Egypt. Its founding member-states weren't ready to surrender their sovereignty, but through the Arab League declared their intent to coöperate and strengthen their ties, and expressed jointly, through the League's charter, their dissatisfaction with the lack of independence granted to Palestine after World War I. This is why a few years later, when Israel declared its independence in 1948, all the Arab League's founding members (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Syria) attacked Israel together as a united front.

For decades, the Arab world refused to officially recognize Israel, considering it nothing more than an illegitimate occupier of Arab land, a thorn in their side they couldn't get rid of. That's why their position was not one of compromise, but the demand that Israel be completely dissolved. Why settle for less? This only began changing a generation or so later, with the Camp David Accords in 1978, when Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with and recognize Israel, to the chagrin of their fellow Arab League members. Eventually, Palestine itself, and then Jordan, would do the same. The people alive in Israel, and the rest of the Middle East, today aren't the same people who were at war in the 1940s. Eventually, you have to move on and put old conflicts to rest.

### Why does the conflict persist to this day?

The grievance that has never gone away is about the 1948 expulsion of 700,000 people from the Israeli-controlled parts of Palestine (reminder: "Palestine" at that time meant the whole area, including all of what we now call Israel). How do we contextualize this number? It's smaller than most major cities, but roughly the same as Leicester (England); Madison, Wisconsin (USA); London, Ontario (Canada); or Dresden (Germany). Imagine if every single person in any of these places were forcibly removed from their homes and made to go, well, anywhere else. The only time this happens in the West is when there's a natural disaster. Hurricane Katrina, the cyclone that hit the US Gulf coast in 2005, displaced about 1.5 million people, and many of them never returned to the places they evacuated, instead continuing their lives elsewhere. This feels very different, though, because they weren't forcibly prevented from returning afterwards if they wanted, and there wasn't a conscious entity that we could blame and want to hold accountable for the storm's destruction.

There were also "population transfers" (which is what the world used to call it when a large number of people were compelled to relocate) in many places around the world in the 20th century. The largest was the partitioning of British India into the modern India and Pakistan, which resulted in about 15 million people moving from one region to the other in both directions. When things like this happen, some people move because they prefer, and may even be enthusiastic, to join the territory they identify with; some of them leave because they're scared of what might happen if they remain on the 'wrong' side after the dust has settled; and many of them are indeed attacked and forced out of the area during all the chaos, as longstanding resentment has one last opportunity to come out, and people are trying to pressure members of the other group into leaving. It's difficult to say how many people were in each of those three categories. If we count two million people who leave the area, and we know there was violence that forced some people out, then how many would've left if everything was peaceful and nobody felt unsafe? For similar reasons, it's hard to say what proportion of Palestinians were physically removed from their homes and attacked versus how many of them chose to leave in fear---nor, if the latter group had stayed, in what proportion of cases those fears would've been accurate. This can all be repeated about instances of Jews fleeing other Middle Eastern countries to Israel. However, in any of these cases, we can be sure the number who were coerced wasn't zero, and it would be improper to be treat any of these migrations as being wholly voluntary events.

Still, there's an interesting question here: how are people still being so affected by something that happened 80 years ago? None of the people affected are alive today. If we kicked everybody out of Dresden tomorrow, would their great-grandchildren still be united by that trauma in 2105? There's a lot more to the story than generational trauma.

This is a question I remember having when I was first learning about the Israel--Palestine conflict. Imagine we *did* forcibly remove everybody from Seattle. That would understandably upset people, but would their grandchildren still be going on about it 80 years later? How haven't people built new lives and moved past this by now? The people who were kicked out in 1947 aren't even alive anymore. The Israeli leadership who kicked them out aren't alive anymore. Is this not a thing of the past by now? We should be able to acknowledge that Israel is a country whose founding involved expelling people from territory, an action that would be unacceptable today. But so many other country's histories also contain bad things. American Indians aren't resorting to terrorism and attacking the United States demanding to get their whole continent back. What keeps this particular fire burning?

The problem is this conflict was always put on hold and delayed just long enough for somebody to fire another shot and start things up again. This has been primarily the 'fault' of the Arab side, who have refused, for decades, to accept compromise that involved Israel existing in any form. The initial crime of Israel expelling people from its territory apparently could not be forgiven, and being vocally anti-Zionist was a way to become popular in the Arab world. They would proclaim their commitment to the destruction of Israel, and by the 1970s Israel had become the main representative of a perceived alliance between Jews and Christians in a global war against Islam or the Islamic world. But even before that, things had quickly stopped being about Israel and Zionism and became about Jews as a people. They talked so badly about Jewish people they might have felt at home in Nazi Germany. Their express goals weren't restitution for the families that were expelled from the region; it was the destruction of the entirety of Israel and the murder of all Jewish people therewithin, from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea. This isn't hyperbole---they proclaimed it explicitly.

In some sense, on some level, the reason the conflict still persists is the fact Israel is a Jewish rather than Muslim country. Why did all the Arab countries oppose the formation of Israel to begin with? Why did they reject the partition plan? Why have they rejected every attempt at compromise or partition since then? From the beginning, they hated the idea of Jewish people having political agency in a country where they get to be the majority instead of being ruled over by Muslims. This is also why the Muslim population opposes political autonomy for Christians, Zoroastrians, Yizidis, or any other non-Muslim religious group in the Middle East, while Islam itself is divided violently along the lines of its major sects (Sunni and Shia). In this part of the world, religion dominates everything, and Muslims want everything to be dominated by Islam. They would be happy to live under another caliphate. The founding of Israel was offensive to them because it wasn't Muslim. They escalated the conflict into war because Israel wasn't Muslim. And the conflict has been prolonged to this day because Jews aren't Muslims. For the Arabs outside of Palestine, in other Arab states, the fact Israel has mistreated a small number of Muslims by kicking them out of Palestine isn't a tragedy. It's a happy coincidence. It plays into their narrative and gives them something to use against Israel over, and over, and over again.

The Arab world has a vast amount of resources at their disposal. They could help the Palestinians. They don't. They could also take in the entire population of Gaza and the West Bank to their own countries, if they had to, but they won't do that either. The reality is they don't care that much about these people. For decades, the reason the Israel--Palestine conflict has continued and couldn't be resolved was because the Palestinian population had become a pawn in the game being played by Arab leaders. They were used as a bludgeon against Israel, a thorn in Israel's side. The Arab leadership didn't *want* the problem to be solved, nor did they want people to be able to move on, so much as they wanted to destroy Israel, and they would prolong the suffering of the Palestinian people if they thought it could help them accomplish that, just as Hamas does today. The Palestinian population was meanwhile sold the lie that the rest of the Arab world stood with them, and that if they just keep fighting---fight, fight, fight, always keep fighting---eventually they would win and take it all. Where has that got them?

And when I say the Arab side, in the past this would mean all the Arab countries. Today, a special emphasis should be placed on Iran. Iran is the country that funds Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah, and other terrorist groups you've probably never heard of. They do this because they don't want the Israel--Palestine conflict to be solved (except by the destruction of Israel), and they prefer instability and conflict in the region.
