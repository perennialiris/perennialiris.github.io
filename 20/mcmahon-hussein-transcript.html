# Transcript of the McMahon--Hussein correspondence

*In many texts, the Sharif of Mecca is now known as **Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi**, but at the time (1915--16) his name was rendered **Husayn**.*

From the Sharif Husayn of Mecca,
<br>to Sir Henry McMahon, His Majesty's High Commissioner at Cairo,
<br>July 14, 1915.

\<blockquote>

Whereas the whole of the Arab nation without any exception have decided in these last years to accomplish their freedom, and grasp the reins of their administration both in theory and practice; and whereas they have found and felt that it is in the interest of the Government of Great Britain to support them and aid them in the attainment of their firm and lawful intentions (which are based upon the maintenance of the honour and dignity of their life) without any ulterior motives whatsoever unconnected with this object;

And whereas it is to their (the Arabs') interest also to prefer the assistance of the Government of Great Britain in consideration of their geographic position and economic interests, and also of the attitude of the above-mentioned Government, which is known to both nations and therefore need not be emphasized.
 
For these reasons, the Arab nation sees fit to limit themselves, as time is short, to asking the Government of Great Britain, if it should think fit, for the approval, through her deputy or representative, of the following fundamental propositions, leaving out all things considered secondary in comparison with these, so that it may prepare all means necessary for attaining this noble purpose, until such time as it finds occasion for making the actual negotiations:

1. England will acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by Mersina and Adana up to the 37th degree of latitude, on which degree fall Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Jezirat (Ibn 'Umar), Amadia, up to the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basra; on the south by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; on the west by the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina. England to approve the proclamation of an Arab Khalifate of Islam.
2. The Arab Government of the Sherif will acknowledge that England shall have the preference in all economic enterprises in the Arab countries whenever conditions of enterprises are otherwise equal.
3. For the security of this Arab independence and the certainty of such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties will offer mutual assistance, to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign Power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties.
4. If one of the parties enters into an aggressive conflict, the other party will assume a neutral attitude, and in case of such party wishing the other to join forces, both to meet and discuss the conditions.
5. England will acknowledge the abolition of foreign privileges in the Arab countries, and will assist the Government of the Sherif in an International Convention for confirming such abolition.
6. Articles 3 and 4 of this treaty will remain in vigour for fifteen years, and, if either wishes it to be renewed, one year's notice before lapse of treaty is to be given.

Consequently, and as the whole of the Arab nation have (praise be to God) agreed and united for the attainment, at all costs and finally, of this noble object, they beg the Government of Great Britain to answer them positively or negatively in a period of thirty days after receiving this intimation; and if this period should lapse before they receive an answer, they reserve to themselves complete freedom of action. Moreover, we (the Sherif's family) will consider ourselves free in work and deed from the bonds of our previous declaration which we made through Ali Effendi.

From McMahon to Husayn,
<br>August 30, 1915,
<br>To his Highness the Sherif Hussein.

\<blockquote>

*(After compliments and salutations.)*

We have the honour to thank you for your frank expressions of the sincerity of your feeling towards England. We rejoice, moreover, that your Highness and your people are of one opinion---that Arab interests are English interests and English Arab. To this intent, we confirm to you the terms of Lord Kitchener's message, which reached you by the hand of Ali Effendi, and in which was stated clearly our desire for the independence of Arabia and its inhabitants, together with our approval of the Arab Khalifate when it should be proclaimed. We declare once more that His Majesty's Government would welcome the resumption of the Khalifate by an Arab of true race. With regard to the questions of limits and boundaries, it would appear to be premature to consume our time in discussing such details in the heat of war, and while, in many portions of them, the Turk is up to now in effective occupation; especially as we have learned, with surprise and regret, that some of the Arabs in those very parts, far from assisting us, are neglecting this their supreme opportunity and are lending their arms to the German and the Turk, to the new despoiler and the old oppressor.

Nevertheless, we are ready to send your Highness for the Holy Cities and the noble Arabs the charitable offerings of Egypt so soon as your Highness shall inform us how and where they should be delivered. We are, moreover, arranging for this your messenger to be admitted and helped on any journey he may make to ourselves.

Friendly reassurances. Salutations!

### No. 3 --- Hussein, 1915-09-09

From Husayn to McMahon,
<br>September 9, 1915
<br>To his Excellency the Most Exalted, the Most Eminent-the British High Commissioner in Egypt; may God grant him Success.

\<blockquote>

With great cheerfulness and delight I received your letter dated the 19th Shawal, 1333 (the 30th August, 1915), and have given it great consideration and regard, in spite of the impression I received from it of ambiguity and its tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our essential point.

It is necessary to make clear to your Excellency our sincerity towards the illustrious British Empire and our confession of preference for it in all cases and matters and under all forms and circumstances. The real interests of the followers of our religion necessitate this. Nevertheless, your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that the coolness and hesitation which you have displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and is a loss of time, and that they are still in the hands of the Government which is ruling them, &c., might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of the sort.

As the limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom we should satisfy and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over, but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits and their word is united on this. Therefore, they have found it necessary first to discuss this point with the Power in whom they now have their confidence and trust as a final appeal, viz., the illustrious British Empire.

Their reason for this union and confidence is mutual interest, the necessity of regulating territorial divisions and the feelings of their inhabitants, so that they may know how to base their future and life, so not to meet her (England?) or any of her Allies in opposition to their resolution which would produce a contrary issue, which God forbid.

For the object is, honourable Minister, the truth which is established on a basis which guarantees the essential sources of life in future.

Yet within these limits they have not included places inhabited by a foreign race. It is a vain show of words and titles.

May God have mercy on the Khalifate and comfort Moslems in it.

I am confident that your Excellency will not doubt that it is not I personally who am demanding of these limits which include only our race, but that they are all proposals of the people, who, in short, believe that they are necessary for economic life.

Is this not right, your Excellency the Minister?

In a word, your high Excellency, we are firm in our sincerity and declaring our preference for loyalty towards you, whether you are satisfied with us, as has been said, or angry.

With reference to your remark in your letter above mentioned that some of our people are still doing their utmost in promoting the interests of Turkey, your goodness (lit. "perfectness") would not permit you to make this an excuse for the tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our demands, demands which I cannot admit that you, as a man of sound opinion, will deny to be necessary for our existence; nay, they are the essential essence of our life, material and moral.

Up to the present moment I am myself with all my might carrying out in my country all things in conformity with the Islamic law, all things which tend to benefit the rest of the Kingdom, and I shall continue to do so until it pleases God to order otherwise.

In order to reassure your Excellency I can declare that the whole country, together with those who
you say are submitting themselves to Turco-German orders, are all waiting the result of these
negotiations, which are dependent only on your refusal or acceptance of the question of the limits
and on your declaration of safeguarding their religion first and then the rest of rights from any harm
or danger.

Whatever the illustrious Government of Great Britain finds conformable to its policy on this subject, communicate it to us and specify to us the course we should follow.

In all cases it is only God's will which shall be executed, and it is God who is the real factor in everything.

With regard to our demand for grain for the natives, and the moneys ("surras") known to the Wakfs' Ministry and all other articles sent here with pilgrims' caravans, high Excellency, my intention in this matter is to confirm your proclamations to the whole world, and especially to the Moslem world, that your antagonism is confined only to the party which has usurped the rights of the Khalifate in which are included the rights of all Moslems.

Moreover the said grain is from the special Wakfs and has nothing to do with politics.

If you think it should be, let the grain of the two years be transported in a special steamer to Jedda in an official manner, in the name of all the natives as usual, and the captain of the steamer or the special "Mamur" detailed as usual every year to hand it over on his arrival at the port will send to the Governor of Jedda asking for the Mamur of the grain at Jedda or a responsible official to take over the grain and give the necessary receipt signed by the said Mamur, that is the Mamur of the grain himself. He should make it a condition that he would (? not) accept any receipt but that signed by this Mamur.

Let the captain of the steamer or the "Mamur" (detailed with the grain) be instructed that if he finds anything contrary to this arrangement he should warn them that he will return home with the cargo. Thereupon the Mamur and the special committee detailed with him, which is known as the committee of the grain for the natives, will take over the grain in the proper form.

Please accept my best regards and salutations.

If you choose to send a reply to this, please send it with the bearer. 29th Shawal, 1333.

#### No. 4 --- McMahon, 1915-10-24

Translation of a letter from McMahon to Husayn,
<br>October 24, 1915,

I have received your letter of the 29th Shawal, 1333, with much pleasure and your expressions of
friendliness and sincerity have given me the greatest satisfaction.

I regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question
of the limits and boundaries with coldness and hesitation; such was not the case, but it appeared to
me that the time had not yet come when that question could be discussed in a conclusive manner.
I have realised, however, from your last letter that you regard this question as one of vital and
urgent importance. I have, therefore, lost no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of
the contents of your letter, and it is with great pleasure that I communicate to you on their behalf the
following statement, which I am confident you will receive with satisfaction:-
The two districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts
of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded
from the limits demanded.
With the above modification, and without prejudice of our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we
accept those limits.
As for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without
detriment to the interest of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of
Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter:-
1. Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the
independence of the Arabs in all the regions within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.
2. Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression and will recognise
their inviolability.
3. When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to
establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those various territories.
4. On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance
of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as may be required for the
formation of a sound form of administration will be British.
5. With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established
position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special administrative arrangements in order to
secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and
to safeguard our mutual economic interests.
I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of
Great Britain towards the aspirations of her friends the Arabs and will result in a firm and lasting
alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries
and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke, which for so many years has pressed
heavily upon them.
I have confined myself in this letter to the more vital and important questions, and if there are any
other matters dealt with in your letter which I have omitted to mention, we may discuss them at
some convenient date in the future.
It was with very great relief and satisfaction that I heard of the safe arrival of the Holy Carpet and
the accompanying offerings which, thanks to the clearness of your directions and the excellence of
your arrangements, were landed without trouble or mishap in spite of the dangers and difficulties
occasioned by the present sad war. May God soon bring a lasting peace and freedom to all peoples!
I am sending this letter by the hand of your trusted and excellent messenger, Sheikh Mohammed Ibn
Arif Ibn Uraifan, and he will inform you of the various matters of interest, but of less vital
importance, which I have not mentioned in this letter.
(Compliments)

Translation of a letter from Husayn to McMahon, November 5, 1915
(In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!)
To his Excellency the most exalted and eminent Minister who is endowed with
the highest authority and soundness of opinion.
May God guide him to do His Will!
I RECEIVED with great pleasure your honoured letter, dated the 15th Zil Hijja (the 24th October,
1915), to which I beg to answer as follows:
1. In order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and at the same time to avoid
all that may cause Islam troubles and hardships-seeing moreover that we have great consideration
for the distinguished qualities and dispositions of the Government of Great Britain-we renounce our
insistence on the inclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. But the two
vilayets of Aleppo and Beirut and their sea coasts are purely Arab vilayets, and there is no
difference between a Moslem and a Christian Arab: they are both descendants of one forefather.
We Moslems will follow the footsteps of the Commander of the Faithful Omar ibn Khattab, and
other Khalifs succeeding him, who ordained in the laws of the Moslem Faith that Moslems should
treat the Christians as they treat themselves. He, Omar, declared with reference to Christians: "They
will have the same privileges and submit to the same duties as ourselves." They will thus enjoy their
civic rights in as much as it accords with the general interests of the whole nation.
2. As the Iraqi vilayets are parts of the pure Arab Kingdom, and were in fact the seat of its
Government in the time of Ali ibn Abu Talib, and in the time of all the Khalifs who succeeded him;
and as in them began the civilisation of the Arabs, and as their towns were the first towns built in
Islam where the Arab power became so great; therefore they are greatly valued by all Arabs far and
near, and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them. Consequently, we cannot satisfy the Arab
nations or make them submit to give us such a title to nobility. But in order to render an accord easy,
and taking into consideration the assurances mentioned in the fifth article of your letter to keep and
guard our mutual interests in that country as they are one and the same, for all these reasons we
might agree to leave under the British administration for a short time those districts now occupied
by the British troops without the rights of either party being prejudiced thereby (especially those of
the Arab nation; which interests are to it economic and vital), and against a suitable sum paid as
compensation to the Arab Kingdom for the period of occupation, in order to meet the expenses
which every new kingdom is bound to support; at the same time respecting your agreements with
the Sheikhs of those districts, and especially those which are essential.
3. In your desire to hasten the movement we see not only advantages, but grounds of apprehension.
The first of these grounds is the fear of the blame of the Moslems of the opposite party (as has
already happened in the past), who would declare that we have revolted against Islam and ruined its
forces. The second is that, standing in the face of Turkey which is supported by all the forces of
Germany, we do not know what Great Britain and her Allies would do if one of the Entente Powers
were weakened and obliged to make peace. We fear that the Arab nation will then be left alone in
the face of Turkey together with her allies, but we would not at all mind if we were to face the Turks
alone. Therefore it is necessary to take these points into consideration in order to avoid a peace
being concluded in which the parties concerned may decide the fate of our people as if we had taken
part in the war without making good our claims to official consideration.
4. The Arab nation has a strong belief that after this war is over the Turks under German influence
will direct their efforts to provoke the. Arabs and violate their rights, both material and moral, to
wipe out their nobility and honour and reduce them to utter submission as they are determined to
ruin them entirely. The reasons for the slowness shown in our action have already been stated.
5. When the Arabs know the Government of Great Britain is their ally who will not leave them to
themselves at the conclusion of peace in the face of Turkey and Germany, and that she will support
and will effectively defend them, then to enter the war at once will, no doubt, be in conformity with
the general interest of the Arabs.
6. Our letter dated the 29th Shaual, 1333 (the 9th September, 1915), saves us the trouble of
repeating our opinions as to articles 3 and 4 of your honoured last letter regarding administration,
Government advisers and officials, especially as you have declared, exalted Minister, that you will
not interfere with internal affairs.
7. The arrival of a clear and definite answer as soon as possible to the above proposals is expected.
We have done our utmost in making concessions in order to come to an agreement satisfying both
parties. We know that our lot in this war will be either a success, which will guarantee to the Arabs
a life becoming their past history, or destruction in the attempt to attain their objects. Had it not
been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment of their objects, I would have
preferred to seclude myself on one of the heights of a mountain, but they, the Arabs, have insisted
that I should guide the movement to this end.
May God keep you safe and victorious, as we devoutly hope and desire.
27th Zil Hijja, 1333.

Translation of a letter from McMahon to Husayn, December 14, 1915
(After customary greetings and acknowledgment of previous letter.)
I AM gratified to observe that you agree to the exclusion of the districts of Mersina and Adana from
boundaries of the Arab territories.
I also note with great pleasure and satisfaction your assurances that the Arabs are determined to act
in conformity with the precepts laid down by Omar Ibn Khattab and the early Khalifs, which secure
the rights and privileges of all religions alike.
In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treaties with Arab chiefs, it is, of
course, understood that this will apply to all territories included in the Arab Kingdom, as the
Government of Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist.
With regard to the vilayets of Aleppo and Beirut, the Government of Great Britain have fully
understood and taken careful note of your observations, but, as the interests of our ally, France, are
involved in them both, the question will require careful consideration and a further communication
on the subject will be addressed to you in due course.
The Government of Great Britain, as I have already informed you, are ready to give all guarantees
of assistance and support within their power to the Arab Kingdom, but their interests demand, as
you yourself have recognised, a friendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Bagdad, and the
adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed consideration than
the present situation and the urgency of these negotiations permit.
We fully appreciate your desire for caution, and have no wish to urge you to hasty action, which
might jeopardise the eventual success of your projects, but, in the meantime, it is most essential that
you should spare no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause and urge them to afford
no assistance to our enemies.
It is on the success of these efforts and on the more active measures which the Arabs may hereafter
take in support of our cause, when the time for action comes, that the permanence and strength of
our agreement must depend.
Under these circumstances I am further directed by the Government of Great Britain to inform you
that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace in terms of
which the freedom of the Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an
essential condition.
As an earnest of our intentions, and in order to aid you in your efforts in our joint cause, I am
sending you by your trustworthy messenger a sum of twenty thousand pounds.
(Customary ending.)

Translation of a letter from Husayn to McMahon, January 1, 1916
(In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!)
To his Excellency the eminent, energetic and magnanimous Minister.
WE received from the bearer your letter, dated the 9th Safar (the 14th December, 1915), with great
respect and honour, and I have understood its contents, which caused me the greatest pleasure and
satisfaction, as it removed that which had made me uneasy.
Your honour will have realised, after the arrival of Mohammed (Faroki) Sherif and his interview
with you, that all our procedure up to the present was of no personal inclination or the like, which
would have been wholly unintelligible, but that everything was the result of the decisions and
desires of our peoples, and that we are but transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires
in the position they (our people) have pressed upon us.
These truths are, in my opinion, very important and deserve your honour's special attention and
consideration.
With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication concerning El Iraq as to the
matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, in order to strengthen the confidence of
Great Britain in our attitude and in our words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give
her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave the
determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice.
As regards the northern parts and their coasts, we have already stated in our previous letter what
were the utmost possible modifications, and all this was only done so to fulfill those aspirations
whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and
desire which impelled us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France
and the agreement made between them during the present wars and calamities; yet we find it our
duty that the eminent minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished,
we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for what we now leave to France in Beirut
and its coasts.
I do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan is of greater security to the
interests and protection of the rights of Great Britain than it is to us, and will necessarily be so
whatever may happen, so that Great Britain may finally see her friends in that contentment and
advancement which she is endeavouring to establish for them now, especially as her Allies being
neighbours to us will be the germ of difficulties and discussion with which there will be no peaceful
conditions. In addition to which the citizens of Beirut will decidedly never accept such
dismemberment, and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which may exercise Great
Britain, certainly not less than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the
reciprocity and indeed the identity of our interests, which is the only cause that caused us never to
care to negotiate with any other Power but you. Consequently, it is impossible to allow any
derogation that gives France, or any other Power, a span of land in those regions.
I declare this, and I have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from the dead, in the
declarations which you give in the conclusion of your honoured letter. Therefore, the honourable
and eminent Minister should believe and be sure, together with Great Britain, that we still remain
firm to our resolution which Storrs learnt from us two years ago, for which we await the
opportunity suitable to our situation, especially in view of that action the time of which has now
come near and which destiny drives towards us with great haste and clearness, so that we and those
who are of our opinion may have reasons for such action against any criticisms or responsibilities
imposed upon us in future.
Your expression "we do not want to push you to any hasty action which might jeopardise the
success of your aim" does not need any more explanation except what we may ask for, when
necessary, such as arms, ammunition, &c.
I deem this sufficient, as I have occupied much of your Honour's time. I beg to offer you my great
veneration and respect.
25th Safar, 1334.

(After customary greetings.)
WE have received with great pleasure and satisfaction your letter of the 25th Safar (the 1st January)
at the hands of your trusty messenger, who has also transmitted to us your verbal messages.
We fully realise and entirely appreciate the motives which guide you in this important question, and
we know well that you are acting entirely in the interests of the Arab peoples and with no thought
beyond their welfare.
We take note of your remarks concerning the vilayet of Baghdad a", and will take the question into
careful consideration when the enemy has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlement
arrives.
As regards the northern parts, we note with satisfaction your desire to avoid anything which might
possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France. It is, as you know, our fixed determination
that nothing shall be permitted to interfere in the slightest degree with our united prosecution of this
war to a victorious conclusion. Moreover, when the victory has been won, the friendship of Great
Britain and France will become yet more firm and enduring, cemented by the blood of Englishmen
and Frenchmen who have died side by side fighting for the cause of right and liberty.
In this great cause Arabia is now associated, and God grant that the result of our mutual efforts and
co-operation will bind us in a lasting friendship to the mutual welfare and happiness of us all.
We are greatly pleased to hear of the action you are taking to win all the Arabs over to our joint
cause, and to dissuade them from giving any assistance to our enemies, and we leave it to your
discretion to seize the most favourable moment for further and more decided measures.
You will doubtless inform us by the bearer of this letter of any manner in which we can assist you
and your requests will always receive our immediate consideration.
You will have heard how El Sayed Ahmed el Sherif el Senussi has been beguiled by evil advice into
hostile action, and it will be a great grief to you to know that he has been so far forgetful of the
interests of the Arabs as to throw in his lot with our enemies. Misfortune has now overtaken him,
and we trust that this will show him his error and lead him to peace for the sake of his poor
misguided followers.
We are sending this letter by the hand of your good messenger, who will also bring to you all our
news.
With salaams.

Translation of a letter from Husayn to McMahon, February 18, 1916
(In the name of the Merciful, the Compassionate!)
To the most noble His Excellency the High Commissioner. May God protect Vim. (After
compliments and respects.)
WE received your Excellency's letter dated 25th Rabi El Awal, and its contents filled us with the
utmost pleasure and satisfaction at the attainment of the required understanding and the intimacy
desired. I ask God to make easy our purposes and prosper our endeavours. Your Excellency will
understand the work that is being done, and the reasons for it from the following: â€” Firstly.-We had
informed your Excellency that we had sent one of our sons to Syria to command the operations
deemed necessary there. We have received a detailed report from him stating that the tyrannies of
the Government there have not left of the persons upon whom they could depend, whether of the
different ranks of soldiers or of others, save only a few, and those of secondary importance; and that
he is awaiting the arrival of the forces announced from different places, especially from the people
of the country and the surrounding Arab regions as Aleppo and the south of Mosul, whose total is
calculated at not less than 100,000 by their estimate; and he intends, if the majority of the forces
mentioned are Arab, to begin the movement by them; and, if otherwise, that is, of the Turks or
others, he will observe their advance to the Canal, and when they begin to fight, his movements
upon them will be different to what they expect.
Secondly.â€”We purposed sending our eldest son to Medina with sufficient forces to strengthen his
brother (who is) in Syria, and with every possibility of occupying the railway line, or carrying out
such operations as circumstances may admit. This is the beginning of the principal movement, and
we are satisfied in its beginning with what he had levied as guards to keep the interior of the
country quiet; they are of the people of Hejaz only, for many reasons, which it would take too long
to set forth; chiefly the difficulties in the way of providing their necessities with secrecy and speed
(although this precaution was not necessary) and to make it easy to bring reinforcements when
needed; this is the summary of what you wished to understand. In my opinion it is sufficient, and it
is to be taken as a foundation and a standard as to our actions in the face of all changes and
unforeseen events which the sequence of events may show. It remains for us to state what we need
at present:
Firstly.â€”The amount of Â£50,000 in gold for the monthly pay of the troops levied, and other things
the necessity of which needs no explanation. We beg you to send it with all possible haste.
Secondly.â€”20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 3,000 sacks of barley, 150 sacks of coffee,
150 sacks of sugar, 5,000 rifles of the modern pattern and the necessary ammunition, and 100 boxes
of the two sample cartridges (enclosed) and of Martini-Henry cartridges and "Aza," that is those of
the rifles of the factory of St. Etienne in France, for the use of those two kinds of rifles of our tribes;
it would not be amiss to send 500 boxes of both kinds.
Thirdly.â€”We think it better that the place of deposit of all these things should be Port Sudan.
Fourthly.â€”As the above provisions and munitions are not needed until the beginning of the
movement (of which we will inform you officially), they should remain at the above place, and
when we need them we will inform the Governor there of the place to which they may be conveyed,
and of the intermediaries who will carry orders for receiving them.
Fifthly.â€”The money required should be sent at once to the Governor of Port Sudan, and a
confidential agent will be sent by us to receive it, either all at once, or in two installments,
according as he is able, and this (Â§) is the (secret) sign to be recognized for accepting the man.
Sixthly.â€”Our envoy who will receive the money will be sent to Port Sudan in three weeks' time,
that is to say, he will be there on the 5th Jamad Awal (9th March) with a letter from us addressed to
Al Khawaga Elias Effendi, saying that he (Elias) will pay him, in accordance with the letter, the rent
of our properties, and the signature will be clear in our name, but we will instruct him to ask for the
Governor of the place, whom you will apprise of this person's arrival. After perusal of the letter, the
money should be given to him on condition that no discussion whatever is to be made with him of
any question concerning us. We beg you most emphatically not to tell him anything, keeping this
affair secret, and he should be treated apparently as if he were nothing out of the way.
Let it not be thought that our appointment of another man results from lack of confidence in the
bearer; it is only to avoid waste of time, for we are appointing him to a task elsewhere. At the same
time we beg you not to embark or send him in a steamer, or officially, the means already arranged
being sufficient.
Seventhly.--Our representative, bearer of the present letter, has been definitely instructed to ensure
the arrival of this, and I think that his mission this time is finished since the condition of things is
known both in general and in detail, and there is no need for sending anyone else. In case of need
for sending information, it will come from us; yet as our next representative will reach you after
three weeks, you may prepare instructions for him to take back. Yet let him be treated simply in
appearance.
Eighthly.--Let the British Government consider this military expenditure in accordance with the
books which will be furnished it, explaining how the money has been spent.
To conclude, my best and numberless salutations beyond all increase.
14 Rabi al Akhar, 1334.

No. 10

Translation of a letter from McMahon to Husayn, March 10, 1916
(After customary greetings.)
We have received your letter of the 14th Rabi el Akhar (the 18th February), duly delivered by your
trusted messenger.
We are grateful to note the active measures which you propose to take. We consider them the most
suitable in the existing circumstances, and they have the approval of His Majesty's Government. I
am pleased to be able to inform you that His Majesty's Government have approved of meeting your
requests, and that which you asked to be sent with all haste is being despatched with your
messenger, who is also the bearer of this letter.
The remainder will be collected as quickly as possible and will be deposited at Port Sudan, where it
will remain until we hear from you officially of the beginning of the movement and of the places to
which they may be conveyed and the intermediaries who will carry out the orders for receiving
them.
The necessary instructions, as set forth in your letter, have been issued to the Governor at Port
Sudan, and he will arrange everything in accordance with your wishes.
Your representative who brought your last letter has been duly facilitated in his journey to Jeizan,
and every assistance has been given him in his mission, which we trust will be crowned with good
results.
We have arranged that, on completion, he will be brought to Port Sudan, whence he will proceed by
the safest means to join you and report the results of his work.
We take the opportunity, in sending this letter, to explain to you a matter which might otherwise not
have been clear to you, and which might have given rise to misunderstanding. There are various
Turkish posts and small garrisons along the coasts of Arabia who are hostile to us, and who are said
to be planning injury to our naval interests in the Red Sea. We may, therefore, find it necessary to
take hostile measures against these posts and garrisons, but we have issued strict instructions that
every care must be taken by our ships to differentiate between the hostile Turkish garrisons and the
innocent Arab inhabitants, towards whom we entertain such friendly feelings.
We give you notice of this matter in case distorted and false reports may reach you of the reasons
for any action which we may be obliged to take.
We have heard rumours that our mutual enemies are endeavouring to construct boats for the purpose
of laying mines in the Red Sea, and of otherwise injuring our interests there, and we beg of you that
you will give us early information should you receive any confirmation of such reports.
We have heard that Ibn Rashid has been selling large quantities of camels to the Turks, which are
being sent up to Damascus.
We hope that you will be able to use influence with him in order that he may cease from this
practice and, if he still persists, that you will be able to arrange for the Arabs who lie between him
and Syria to seize the camels as they pass, a procedure which will be to our mutual advantage.
I am glad to be able to inform you that those misguided Arabs under Sayed Ahmed el Senussi, who
have fallen victims to the wiles of Turkish and German intriguers, are now beginning to see the
error of their ways, and are coming in to us in large numbers, asking for forgiveness and friendship.
We have severely defeated the forces which these intriguers had collected against us, and the eyes
of the Arabs are now becoming open to the deceit which has been practiced upon them.
The capture of Erzerum, and the defeats sustained by the Turks in the Caucasus, are having a great
effect in our favour, and are greatly helping the cause for which we are both working.
We ask God to prosper your endeavors and to further the work which you have taken in hand.
In conclusion, we beg you to accept our warmest salutations and expressions of friendship.
Jamad Awwal, 1334.
