# The Trump appeal

||date
2024-12-03

What does anybody *like* about Donald Trump? It's a question many people ask theirselves, and no answer comes to mind. But it's something that for me has long seemed obvious. Either I'm wrong or everybody else just doesn't get it. Let's compare answers.

To be sure, Trump is somebody with almost no positive qualities. He's not strong or intelligent, he's not resilient or brave, he's not inventive or aspiring. He has no respect for the law, for his country, for his oath of office. He looks and dresses like a clown. He barely won the presidency and was never popular with the American people. His administration was awash with crime and corruption and incompetence. His presidency was by all means a failure. The greatest myth about Donald Trump is that he's wealthy and successful. He's only wealthy. People don't realize how much he inherited, nor how little he's done with any of it, aside from every now and then trying to do his own thing and failing. If not for his rich father, none of us would have any idea who this person is, because by every measure but his bank account, he's worthless.

And he lies constantly, shamelessly. He doesn't even care that we can tell he's lying. If you prove he's lying, he'll just lie some more. He barely even tries. He's not a clever manipulator. He's not a mastermind. He just has no respect for the truth, so he lies brazenly to your face and expects that nobody is ever going to do anything about it. That probably gives us a small insight into the kind of sad, privileged upbringing he came from.

If all of this is true, then how could such a person have a cult of personality around him? How could such a person maintain a loyal following, such devotion from his followers, through thick and thin? Trump's supporters don't just think he's a competent executive. They downright love the man. It's almost sickening.

## The only honest man in Washington

In the Danish folktale, *The Emperor's New Clothes*, a king is tricked by men who claim to be selling magical robes invisible only to those who are incompetent or stupid. Eventually everybody is playing along, pretending to see robes that aren't there, each person believing they're the only one who can't see them. It takes the innocence of a child to blurt out that the king has no clothes for everybody to realize they've been had.

If you're a politician or public figure, you're expected to be polite and uncontroversial. It's called being politically correct or something. For example, a politician might say "rural folks with little economic and education opportunities", instead of "stupid hick fucks". We try to phrase things sensitively, delicately, to avoid offending your own constituents. There are various notions of things that one should and shouldn't say, if you're trying to have broad appeal and be a uniting leader.

That's what many people are sick of. They see it as a dishonest game that politicians all play together on stage, akin to the people who go along with the lie of the emperor's robes. Trump, then, is the lone truth-teller, somebody who blurts out the truth that we all know, but nobody else is brave enough to say. So often when Trump is criticized for saying something that Mitt Romney would never, it's actually an example of what his supporters consider his best quality.

Trump is, in short, *the guy who says what we're all thinking*. That's his power. That's what people love about him.

Think about his various controversies. Early in his first campaign, people said John McCain was a war hero. Trump challenges this, saying he's just called a war hero because he got captured. If you look into it, that's sort of true. McCain was captured and tortured. He didn't get called a hero because he ran bravely into battle and saved a bunch of people or something. He flew a plane in the Vietnam war, and his plane got shot down at some point and he was taken prisoner for 6 years.

Many people saw this as Trump being a disrespectful jackass. Others viewed it as Trump being defiant, irreverent, not playing into the politically correct game the media wanted him to play. Why does he need to give McCain some kind of deference or respect just because his plane got shot down? A lot of people watching thought to theirselves "hmm, good point actually". They were happy to go along with that war hero narrative in the past, but Trump snapped them out of it by challenging the orthodoxy.

I remember when Trump made headlines by referring to a bunch of poor countries like Haiti as 'shithole countries'. Polite society hissed, but people throughout the rest of society thought "well yeah, I mean, they *are* shithole countries". Trump isn't *wrong*---he's just saying the thing you're *not supposed to* say. How brave! And oh how *honest* of him!

In recent memory, during the 2024 race, Trump said he didn't know Harris was black. He mispronounced her name. It turns out lots of people in the country also thought she was Indian or something, or weren't sure what her ethnicity was, and despite her being vice president for the last four years, a lot of people were also mispronouncing her name. Trump tapped into the stupid zeitgeist. The crowd thinks it, Trump says it. The other politicians and newscaster know-it-alls are drinking their lattes, meanwhile Trump is on stage going "wait, kuh-malla's a black? .. person?"

Trump said he doesn't like paying overtime. Years ago, he said he tries to get out of paying contractors. And he tries to get out of paying taxes as much as possible. For a lot of people, this is stuff all rich people think. Trump is the only one honest enough to say it out loud. So it's actually to his credit that he does. Of course he'd like to pay people less, and pay less taxes. What's the problem, news media? Don't like someone who tells the truth?

Hey, remember when John Dingall died and Trump joked about how he's in hell now? Funny, speaking his mind even when it might be shocking. Do you remember that time he made fun of a disabled reporter? That's right, he doesn't give a shit. Remember all those times he referred to the press as the enemy of the people and called CNN fake news? That's right, he stands up for himself, even when the media doesn't like it. Remember that time he made fun of Chris Christie for being fat (even though he's also fat) and called Ted Cruz's wife ugly? He's not afraid of the establishment politicians. Hey, remember when the *Access Hollywood* tape came out and Trump says he just walks up to women and grabs them because they'll let him if they know you're a big star? That's our Trump---tellin' it like it is.

As soon as you start thinking about it this way, everything clicks. It all makes sense.

## High class, but low class

Who first said Trump is a poor man's idea of a rich man? No, wait, was it a dumb person's idea of a smart person? No, that can't be right. ... I just looked it up, and apparently the origin is disputed, so whatever. The point is that Trump is, indeed, a special kind of rich person. He's not like those *other* rich people. He's not refined or highly educated, he has no appreciation for art, or really anything deep, meaningful, or challenging. He's tacky, classless, he has no taste. He covers things in gold because he thinks gold is what rich people are supposed to like. His favourite food is McDonalds. He orders his steak well-done and puts ketchup on it. He doesn't use big words. He talks like an idiot. He even *types* like an idiot (or gets other people to type like an idiot for him). Bill Burr once said he likes George Bush because he makes him feel like he could be president too. In the same way, Donald Trump makes people feel like they could be billionaires. Because why not? If this fucking imbecile ended up rich, why not you?

In a twisted way, I think Trump has a mind closer to the working poor than the mind of other billionaires. Think about it like this: if you gave some random truck driver billions of dollars out of the blue, what would they do with it? They might immediately go grocery shopping. Buy a house, a car? Go to the doctor? But after all of those immediate things come to mind, what would their life end up like, if they didn't run out of money? I'm sure some poor people would end up pursuing something spiritually enriching and meaningful, giving to charity, travelling the world, surfing, trying new things, playing with cheetahs or something.

But people who are particularly shallow, with closed minds and no curiosity about the world? They would probably end up a lot like Trump. He basically just lives in hotels and eats fast food and plays golf. His biggest goal for a long time was trying to get himself on television because he wanted attention and fame and recognition. He kept throwing some of his money at business ventures that would fail and were just an excuse to plaster his name on stuff because he wants to feel like he did something. He goes around perving on little girls and married some random trophy-wife model and paid to have sex with porn stars. Every so often he would go on TV and self-importantly ramble about topics he knows nothing about, but some reporter would talk to him like he's important because they know he's rich.

Trump and a lot of random guys in society are on the same wavelength. Trump thinks the way they do. That's why all the stupid, ugly things he blurts out are appealing to them, and they think of him as 'their guy' despite the fact they know he's a billionaire. Because he's kind of like how they'd be if they were billionaires too. He's high class, but he's low class.

I wonder, is the future of politicians just going to be simple-minded people blurting out every dumb thought that comes to mind, hoping to channel the spirit of the masses like how Trump did? Let's pray the answer's no.

# Trump and Russia

||date
2025-03-06

Americans used to be resolutely against Russia. They all identified and understood Russia to be an enemy of their interests, a bad actor on the world stage. Many remember the Cold War, and understand the extent to which Russia today still represents the USSR---as the country has fallen back into dictatorship, led by a former KGB agent, and is pushing around its Eastern European neighbours. In 2012, Mitt Romney called Russia "without question, our number one geopolitical foe". Today, everybody can watch as America does Russia's bidding, as America sides with them against Ukraine---but why?

## Theory 1: Blackmail

The details are hazy, but there's a theory that goes like this: Trump works in real estate, in a city full of crime and corruption, so this could've happened as early as the 1980s. He---and possibly Giuliani---at some point got in bed with Russian operatives, who got dirt, if not on both of them then at least on Trump. There have been numerous allegations over the years that Trump represents a potentially major security threat because he is vulnerable to blackmail. He's lived a scandalous life, he pays bribes, he commits various crimes, he engages in strange and embarrassing sexual behaviour. In 2017, an additional **allegation** was that Trump had visited Russia---which we do know to be true---but that while there, he engaged in sexual acts with prostitutes and had them do god knows what.

In 2016, Trump's campaign, including his personal lawyers and family members, met with Russian operatives in his place of residence in hopes of getting dirt on their Democratic Party opponent. Russian hackers targeted the Democratic Party campaign, and published their information on WikiLeaks, which the Trump campaign was also in direct contact with. Trump, once in office, is completely subservient to Russian interests. He gets on stage at Helsinki and claims that he would take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of all his own government's intelligence agencies. He also insists on having numerous one-on-one meetings with Putin that nobody else was ever privy to.

Imagine if it turned out Putin had something on Trump the entire time. He wasn't giving Trump orders, but he made it clear to Trump early on that if he didn't play ball with the Russian agenda, they would release something to make his life hell---and, perhaps also crucially, Trump didn't really see going along with the Russian agenda as that big an ask anyway.

The question is, what could they possibly have on him? What would be enough? His tax returns? Proof of crime? Proof that he cheated on his wife? Nobody would even care about any of that. His supporters would come up with some kind of justification, a whataboutism about some left-winger who did something similar, and forget about it by next week. To be effective, it would have to be crazy bad.

The only thing I can think of would be pedophilia, or a violent rape (not a "he pressured me into it and I froze up" rape, since his followers would all dispute the legitimacy of that and forgive him, but a "she's crying the whole time and he keeps hitting her and telling her to shut up while he moans over her cries" kind of violent fuckfest). What else, short of an extreme possibility like this, would Trump even care about?

## Theory 2: Spite

Trump isn't a successful businessman. He was just born into more money than he's worth, not as a big pile of cash but as an already-functioning real estate empire that constantly brings in money without him having to really do anything. If I had inherited what Trump did, I could be richer than he is today by just sitting on my hands doing nothing. The few times Trump has tried to do something on his own, most of them have failed---you've probably heard about many of them (Trump steaks, Trump university, Trump vodka, Trump whatever). He's a simple man: he thinks his last name sounds cool and manly, so he finds a company that makes a product and pays them to put his name on it. He doesn't actually *do* anything beyond that.

Trump's life changed when he got into doing reality television. As the host of *The Apprentice*, he was able to broadcast a completely make-believe version of himself into Americans' homes: a powerful, successful businessman who made tough decisions with conviction. It was like he was play-acting his personal fantasy, the life that he wanted but never actually had. The show was a hit, and his salary for being the face of it is where a huge portion of Trump's wealth actually came from, not real estate. He's rich like Judge Judy.

Trump wanted to mingle with successful rich people. He wanted to be respected in that community. He never was. He tried, but he was largely rejected by the actual elites---the real billionaires, the ones who actually ran businesses instead of just pretending to on TV. He wished that he could've been somebody like Richard Branson or Michael Bloomberg. Everybody who was anybody saw Trump as a silver-spoon moron who was born into wealth, did nothing with any of it, and talked like somebody who wouldn't be qualified for middle management. They laughed at him, they didn't take him seriously, and he hated them all for it. That's why he became so insecure about his wealth (because that's literally all he has), and why he isolated himself as an 'outsider' up in his big-boy tower, the one with is name on the side in big letters.

Barack Obama angered Trump because he had the admiration and respect that Trump wanted, and Trump didn't think he deserved it. He wasn't even a billionaire! There must be something wrong, something off about him, some disqualifying factor. "He can't have won---he must have cheated!" Trump became a leading voice in the 'birther' movement, trying to disqualify Obama from being president at all. Obama, like the Manhattan billionaires, represented an elite class of American society that Trump wanted to be a part of, but it was a club he couldn't get into. Again, they laughed at him.

Now president, Trump harbours a personal resentment for the American elite and their ideology. He hates American business leaders, he hates American politicians, he hates all the people who ran the show before him. He *was* the loser, but now he's finally getting his revenge---and upsetting the international order is one of the ways that he's doing it. These people, these *career politicians* and *people with actual university degrees* all think Russia is bad? The enemy of Trump's enemy is Trump's friend. If Obama, McCain, and Hillary all didn't like Putin, then maybe Putin isn't so bad.

## Theory 3: Trump's (lack of) values

Most normal people look at the Russia--Ukraine conflict and instantly, obviously understand why Russia is the villain. The only people who don't think so did initially, and needed very strong arguments---or cash bribes---to pull them over into being sympathetic to Russia's twisted narrative. This is something Trump doesn't relate to at all. On some level---not even very deep down, but at least a little bit beneath the surface---Trump doesn't get why he's supposed to be on Ukraine's side. He looks at the Russian--Ukraine war and if it were up to him, he would've joined in on the side of Russia and helped them conquer Ukraine. Why not?

Trump's America doesn't have any real values or virtues. It would probably go around the world and help whichever side in any given conflict is willing to pay America the most, or just back the side that's already winning, in order to never lose. It would stand for nothing aside from its own self-enrichment. Freedom, democracy, peace---to Trump, these are just words that you say into a camera when the teleprompter tells you to. He doesn't care about any of it.

Trump doesn't think Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Il Sung, or any other autocrat are doing something wrong by ruling over their countries undemocratically, suppressing their opposition, curtailing the free press, and surrounding theirselves with yes-men losers who just tell them whatever they want to hear. To Trump, these guys are just getting away with exactly what he wishes he could do here in America. It's not really clear to him why these guys should be his enemy---aside from that all the American elites, whom he hates, act like that's how it ought to be.

Trump feels more at home, psychologically, with men like them than around a Western politician who actually governs, actually works with other people in their government, actually cares about their people, and actually follows laws instead of acting like they're above them.
