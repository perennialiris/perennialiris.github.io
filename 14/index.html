# Reasons I'm glad to be Canadian |2024-12-08

I encounter Americans who make fun of Canada and imply that I should wish I were American instead. They ask me if I'm ever going to move to the US. I ask, why would I? It's so funny they assume I'd want to. Why don't they move here? I think we have it better overall.

The right wing in America sees Canada like a more left-leaning version of America, so they have an ideological motivation to portray it as a bad place. The result is any time something happens here, I see lies about it spread across the American social-media-bullshit-o-sphere. That seems to be getting worse over time.

### 1. Drug laws

In general our approach to drugs seems less extreme and crazy and stupid. For so many years, my god, that whole 'war on drugs' nonsense. We legalized cannabis nationwide in 2018, so I can just buy chocolate with marijuana at a store if I want it.

I figure we must also do a better job regulating pharmaceuticals, because the few times I've had access to an American television channel there were constantly ads for drugs telling me to ask my doctor for their stuff. That's not really a thing here, beyond ads for basic over-the-counter stuff like Pepto-Bismol or Claritin.

### 2. Healthcare

Access to healthcare has been a huge political issue in the US for what feels like my whole life. Barack Obama was fighting to pass legislation about it 15 years ago and it's still an issue today. There are people go bankrupt and lose everything to random medical bankruptcy over things that would be completely free for me. Even if it's not common, it seems like an area of risk that I'm glad to not have to deal with or worry about.

Canada doesn't have as comprehensive a state medical service as some other countries. There's basically government-run health insurance, which you use to pay providers. It doesn't pay for all your drugs, unless you're low-income, in which case it does, but you pay out of pocket when you pick things up at the pharmacy. But if you get cancer and need surgery or something, it's just free, and you don't have to worry about getting fucked by the insurance company or whatever. There's a peace of mind with that type of system.

### 3. Abortion

Not only is abortion fully legal across Canada federally, but nobody cares about it. If you watch a debate before a general where the party leaders show up to talk about who would make the best Prime Minister, abortion isn't even a topic anyone gets asked about, because it's just not controversial and nobody is trying to ban it. This has been a really nice benefit over the last decade while listening to people in the US moving to try and restrict it, and in some of the country succeeding. Yikes. Not up here.

It took me some way into adulthood before I even realized how many people in the US care about abortion as much as they do. The only time I'd really hear about it was when you'd pass these people on the street in the city holding up signs on the corner with pictures of fetuses. You'd roll your eyes and walk past them like any other street preacher. It didn't seem like a 'serious' thing to care about.

### 4. Guns

If you're an American who loves guns, then I guess this isn't really a point for us. If you think guns are a problem and you wish your politicians would do more to regulate them, then oh, hey, look at us, we do that. And there's no school shootings here, predictably.

I've never seen a gun. I've seen them in movies and televisions, of course, but not in person. I've spoken with Americans who find that difficult to believe at first. I don't know how many Britons or Canadians can say the same, but the point is they're not ubiquitous here, they're difficult to get, and as a result there's way fewer people shooting each other, because duh.

I knew somebody who took a road trip from eastern Canada down to California over a few weeks. They came back and testified the biggest 'culture shock' was how after some point, you just start seeing people walking around with guns, for like, no reason.

### 5. LGBT Acceptance

Canada legalized gay marriage like 20 years ago now. The right-wing parties aren't anti-gay. In America, you still have people who get on stage, talk about how homosexuality is disgusting and worthless and we need to protect our children's innocent ears from so much as hearing that it exists, and then they get elected and become part of the government. Not here.

There's opposition to things outside of broad strokes when it comes to trans people. The right-wing party didn't support adding trans people to our anti-discrimination legislation in 2016 (Bill C-16). I think every member voted against it (probably just as a united front thing, to be fair, since they couldn't stop the Liberal majority from passing it anyway).

In Alberta, they're currently working on some legislation about rules for minors accessing gender-affirming healthcare---but not only is it not that unreasonable (if I recall, they wanted a floor of 15 for access to hormone therapy and 18 for access to surgeries, which seems fine), but when the Alberta Premier (a Premier is sort of like a state governor) spoke on the issue, she didn't sound angry or hateful. She wasn't trying to make people fear that a contagion was coming for their kids. The narrative was purely that we should probably have some limits in place, to prevent people making decisions they regret while they're too young. That's as anti-LGBT as we get.

In general, Canada remains one of the most LGBT-friendly places in the world, both in terms of legal rights and general public sentiment. And that's reflected in government. We're not *the* most friendly, because of those pesky little Northern European countries like Iceland where everything seems to be perfect somehow, but compared with almost everywhere else, it's great here, and I wouldn't want to move to the US if I were a queer anything.

### 6. Political culture

You may have read about scandals involving Justin Trudeau, who's been our Prime Minister since 2015, but what he's accused of was always rather minor in the grand scheme of things, and more importantly, we actually *cared* and investigated him. And for his part, Trudeau didn't stand in the way of investigations, he took critical questions about the matter publicly, and in one case voluntarily waived his attorney-client privilege to allow the people around him to speak. For the most part, considering how long he's been in the international spotlight, he's been an honest and responsible actor, especially compared with leaders across many other countries.

The worst we know about Trudeau is that he received gifts and took vacations in ways that violated conflict of interest rules. There was also an investigation into whether Trudeau attempted to influence the way our Attorney General (AG) handled the prosecution of a major Québec-based construction company called **SNC-Lavalin**. In 2015, the company was charged with fraud and corruption for their involvement in bribing officials in Libya, and they were trying to get a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to avoid losing access to federal contracts. In late 2018, after the AG resisted that option, a member of the Privy Council (*not* the Prime Minister's office) called her and said Trudeau wanted a DPA for SNC-Lavalin. A few months later she was removed and appointed head of a different department, allegedly for not agreeing to go easier on SNC-Lavalin. The press got wind of this, she stepped down from the position she had been moved to, and so began the controversy.

Trudeau denies that decision had anything to do with that case, and it was simply part of a broader cabinet reshuffle due to resignations in other places. The member who spoke with the AG also denies that Trudeau was aware of their phone call. Trudeau later implied he *did* support SNC-Lavalin being offered a DPA, but accepted responsibility for the poor way this was handled. The problem was just that it's against the rules for him to do anything that could compromise the prosecutorial independence of the Department of Justice, which includes so much as making a remark to a sitting Attorney General about how you want them to handle a specific case.

In the grand scheme of things, this was a very minor issue, if we assume Trudeau did everything he's accused of doing. That's not to say we shouldn't care---I'm glad we do---but to further emphasize how great it is to live in a country that actually cares and does something about it when leadership does something wrong. Trudeau has served as head of government for over 9 years now and the SNC-Lavalin scandal was the worst thing to happen to him so far, and it pales in comparison with the brazen crime and corruption happening in the US, which seemingly nobody is going to really be held accountable for. Your problems trump our problems and it's not even close.

### 7. System of Government

The longer I live, the more justified I feel being an advocate of parliamentary sovereignty, or parliamentary supremacy. The House of Commons is the main organ of government, the thing that actually wields most power and makes most decisions, and if the House has a disagreement with some other body of government, the House wins. That's how it should be. That's what made Britain great. And Canada has done a good job to inherit from this tradition.

In the United States, they call it the House of Representatives. The House is probably the most genuine expression of American democracy. For some reason, they keep the executive branch detached from this entirely, and they elect the executive in a strange way for strange reasons that can result in the candidate with fewer votes winning and not even having support of the legislature, despite the legislature having a clear majority. Why? To all of this.

Their supreme court has slowly accrued far too much power, to a point where today it can just cancel out anything the legislature tries to do at any time, and effectively change the law of the land at its own whim. Tomorrow, their supreme court justices could decide that any random law on the books is actually unconstitutional for whatever reason they can come up with, and like that, it's gone. In fact, a lot of positive changes throughout American history have been the result of a forward-thinking supreme court just making things up, like "yeah actually you know what? segregation just became unconstitutional". When the US legalized gay marriage in 2015, it wasn't because anybody in society had changed their mind about it beyond a few judges, who decided to 'interpret' that their constitution, written in 1776, somehow implied a right for gay couples to marry. What the fuck? How is this how anything works?

Their senate is also a mess. There's a senate in Canada, too, but it has far less influence over government than the American one, which is incredibly powerful in comparison with the upper chamber of other democracies. It's *intended* to be a check on popular rule, based on the Ancient Roman senate (from the Latin for *senior*), an assembly representing the hereditary aristocracy. In early America, senators weren't elected by popular vote as they are today, but appointed by state legislatures, meaning they would represent the interests of the institutions *against* populist impulses. The House of Lords in the UK is similar. Its positions are lifetime appointments and given through inheritance and to church members, making it a distinctly anti-democratic part of the system overall (and to be sure, it's perfectly defensible to have anti-democratic elements within a broadly democratic system).

But the power of the House of Lords has been diminished greatly over time, chipped away at in the same way as the power of the monarchy has been. The concept in both cases was to say *fine*, the people may elect their own representatives and make laws---but we, the older and more established ruling class, want to maintain some veto power, just in case. And so it was that everything the House of Commons did must also go through the House of Lords, and then be given royal assent (being signed by the monarch---or in America's case, the president). And then over time, as we got used to this whole *democracy* thing, more and more power was assumed by the House, until now their involvement has been reduced to formality: the House of Lords and the monarch will *always* consent to what the House passes. In practice the Lords may at most *delay* a motion by sending it back for review, but ultimately the legislative assembly of the elected lower house gets what it wants.

The thought behind it notwithstanding, the US Senate is certainly *not* a representative of institutional power by wise, old elders. They're just random people who are elected the same way House members are. The Senate is less democratic than the House, but not in a conservative way that favours people with more experience or merit. Instead it's because its seats are distributed in a way that gives far more power to regions with smaller populations (because every state gets 2 senators no matter its size). It would seem absurd in any other context. Canadians may imagine if Ontario and Québec had as much power federally as Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan. Why should anybody stand for that? But in America, California (with a population of 38 million), Texas (30 million), and New York state (20 million) all have equal power and representation with Mississippi (3 million), Rhode Island (1 million), and New Mexico (2 million). The result is the American government reflects the views and interests of lower-population states---which as it happens tend to be poorer, less educated, more socially prejudiced, and have economic interests more aligned with primary industry.

The presidential race is also completely fucked by their stupid electoral college, and not simply because it's something more complicated than popular vote (to be fair, Prime Ministers aren't elected by popular vote either). It's because if your state's electoral points are definitely going in one direction, any excess votes don't do anything. California contributes 54 electoral votes to the presidential race, for example, and if you win California with 15 million votes, you don't get anything *more* by winning California with 20 million votes. People who live in California realize this, and many won't even bother voting as a result, and presidential candidates have little reason to care what people in California think, because that place is a done deal. And so are most states. Thus instead of talking about popular issues that most of the country wants, the national conversation during election season becomes only about the needs of people who live in 'swing states', i.e. the ones where the polling numbers are relatively close. Suddenly what pollsters think voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania care about are the most important issues in the country. It's all so stupid.

The Canadian system isn't perfect, and maybe on a different day I'l discuss its shortcomings and the ways it could be improved, because there are some countries who've figured out something better. But holy shit, at least we don't have the American system. We don't envy you.

### 8. Fewer religious nutjobs

We're not an irreligious nation, but I don't know the last time I heard a Canadian politician get on stage and talking about how they need to protect Christianity or whatever. Sure, not all American politicians are like that, but the ones who *are* still have a hand in how things are run. Nobody talks about how Canada is fundamentally a Christian nation and waves a Bible around. How could you even get that impression? Nor is anybody trying to put the 10 commandments on the walls in your kid's schools or any other nonsense like that.

It's not just about passing explicitly religious laws, though. There are people who 'hide their power levels' when it comes to being religious zealots who pursue positions of authority and it undoubtedly affects their decisions and view of the world. It seems to be a real problem in the US right now, both in the House and on their Supreme Court.

### 9. Less political violence and extremism

The United States has a militia problem. There are thousands of people across the country with radical political views who are allowed to organize and train in paramilitary organizations, and every so often they test the waters by exerting power to affect the legislative process.

I remember this happening in 2019 in Oregon, a state where this is particularly bad. The state legislature was passing some education spending bills and introducing a carbon tax, and despite the leading party having a majority in both chambers, things were delayed because the senators from the Republican Party refused to attend senate sessions. The state state senate only has 30 members, and the senate rules were you needed 20 present for a quorum, so the 12 Republican members leaving meant the senate couldn't operate. A number of them even left the state entirely.

The Oregon governor ordered the state police to find the senators and bring them to the capitol, at which point things got even messier, as Republican senators replied saying they would kill police who try and capture them, and local militias got involved. Two---called the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers---made public statements threatening state officials and saying they would start a civil war. A few days later, the senate session was cancelled in response to the state police warning about a militia threat.

This isn't the only time something like this happened. It's just the example I'm choosing to talk about. And cases like it didn't get nearly enough attention nationally. Most people I speak with today don't remember this event at all. Unless they're from Oregon, in which case *maybe* they do, but people have short memories and our standards have fallen so much in the last decade that an event like this, despite its absurdity, just gets overshadowed.

The militia problem has only got worse since then. A year and a half later, there were various militias involved in the attempted coup at the American capitol on January 6. Now I'm anticipating things getting even worse as the Republican Party, the entity that's friendly to these nutjobs, are in power again.

### 10. No originalism or "founding fathers" cult

No, you can't pass that law, because it contradicts our sacred text, written 240 years ago by people not around for us to consult about their meaning and intentions. What would the founders think of this? Why did they give us a second amendment? What do you think James Madison had in mind when he wrote this or that? Good grief.

This is one of the things I hate most about American politics: the attachment to and fixation on their governing document, that is now the oldest in the world of its kind. And it's an emperor with no clothes, because the country doesn't *actually* follow its original intent. The federal government today isn't what it was in 1776. And who cares that it's not? But on so many issues, Americans' thinking stops as soon as they realize something is unconstitutional. It's unconstitutional, therefore it's bad. Their constitution trumps not only all other law in the land, but all reason and experience. And your allegiance to this constitution is considered most important. To people outside America, it all just comes off as dumb. It's like religious thinking.

In Britain, Canada, and elsewhere, there is respect for institutions and for the rule of law and our broad traditional precedent, but this is not so rigid, so archaic, and so divorced from modern experience as the American constitution. I'm so glad that we don't need to engage in debate about what, say, Alex Campbell would've thought about the government's latest tax policies were he alive today. I doubt he should *want* to be the guiding force for how people 150 years later should govern theirselves. Nor would the American founders desire the way they're treated in American life today, for that matter.

Speaking of which, I'm so glad we don't have 'founding fathers'. Except we do, sort of: there are people whom in Canada we call the founders of confederation, but they are not venerated and worshipped in the way the American founders are. It's just part of a normal historical study, as people in any nation do. We also learn about how early Canadian politics was greatly influenced by Sir John A. Macdonald, for example.

By comparison, the American founders appear to occupy the same place in the American psyche as do saints or prophets. Is it because they lacked a monarch whose face they could plaster onto everything instead? Thankfully, monarchy provides a *living* figurehead. Insofar as monarchs affect policy at all, it's the latest one that we consult, not the oldest in recorded history. Nobody says that we should answer modern policy questions by trying to figure out what Alexander Mackenzie would've thought if he were still alive.

### 11. It's less hot

Do you consider 8°C/46°F to be cold outside? Then shut up, you're wrong.

Part of why I'd never want to live in America comes down to the fact most of it is too far south and therefore unreasonably hot. In summer this year, it was going over 41°C/105°F in Texas and California. What the fuck is that? If it's over 32°C/90°F, I'm probably not leaving my house until after dark.

I already hate summers here in Canada because it gets uncomfortably hot and humid for a few weeks. This year, it felt more like a few months.

On the flipside, fuck anywhere that doesn't get snow. I wouldn't want to go the rest of my life without a proper winter. It blows my mind when I meet immigrants to Canada who tell me this is their first time experiencing it. Like, what? That's like going somewhere they don't have… uh, I don't know, some other ubiquitous thing. Imagine meeting somebody and they say they've never seen birds before. Any bird. Or trees. Or sand. There are just certain things you take for granted as normal features of the world. Rain. Clouds? For me, snow is part of that. It would feel so wrong to be somewhere it never snows. Those places are wrong and therefore bad.

### 12. The French

I'm not French and my family is not of any French origin, but you know what? I love the French. Hating on the French for no particular reason is practically an internet meme, and before that it was a British cultural item. We just hate the French for no reason. It's one of the dumbest parts of British culture, because people take it too seriously, and it overflows from being a self-aware 'sibling rivalry' kind of neighbourly hate and becomes people seriously, genuinely hating on French people. I simply don't care for it.

France is one of the countries that has contributed most to civilization, probably second only to Britain. They have an incredible history and culture to be proud of. I'd feel like an idiot trying to deny their qualities and belittle them. And I respect their pride and refusal to learn English. And it's funny that Americans hate them for it when they act the same way.

The French were also one of the first major powers, alongside the British, that explored and settled the region that would become Canada today. And the Québécois, whose existence owes to that early movement, are a fine part of the country today that we should be glad to have. Things weren't always good between us---in the 1970s things got violent, and for a few decades Québéois separatism seemed like a realistic possibility. It was an interesting demonstration of our liberal ethos that we explicitly committed to let them leave should a majority of Québécois vote in favour of it. It's left us in an interesting spot as a large bilingual nation with this unique combination and balance of cultures. I like it.

## But hey, America isn't all bad

In the grand scheme of things, the US is a country with a lot to offer. Thank-you for all your media, culture, economic innovation, and your various military commitments. America makes the world a better place. And while I wouldn't prefer to live there, it's still better than most other places on Earth, so don't feel bad.

In Canada and other countries, patriotism and nationalism exist, but it doesn't take the form of chanting "we're number one" and saying "we're the best country in the world". That aspect of American culture often comes off as strange to the rest of us. It's more normal to say you love your country because *it's yours*, and you therefore feel a connection to it, like how you love your family. It shouldn't require saying "my family is the best family ever, way better than everyone else's families".

This perspective is better because it leaves space to respect other people loving their own like you do yours. And there are Americans who genuinely love their country, which I respect. I don't want you to not like where you're from, but to recognize that other places have advantages too, and I'm perfectly justified in not feeling envious of you.
