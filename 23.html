# Passing |2025-02-24

^*The cameras aren't rolling yet, are they? Okay. How do I look?*<br>*Am I sitting properly? I don't want to sit like a man.*

### The tragedy of passing

Hi, my name's Emily---I mean, uh, no, wait, don't call me that around my family. The name my parents gave me was Connor. Ugh. I'm a trans woman, but like, in the closet. I don't know. I don't want everyone I know to disown me. Maybe I'm not really trans, anyway. I don't know.

My life is one of denial. I want to do girly stuff, sort of, I mean, as an experiment, but I also don't want people to think I'm too gay, you know? So I talk with a pretty low voice, and I, like, try to do manly things. I drink a beer sometimes. I don't want to give anyone the wrong idea. In fact, I want to do things that make them thing "nah, Connor's straight, I mean come on, look at him." That'll keep them away. Last year, I shaved my head. That's not something a trans person would do, right?

*When you're closeted and trying to not have people be suspicious of you, because you're afraid of negative perceptions from people in your life, the result is you're always self-aware, checking yourself, never fully relaxed around others. It's an inauthentic life, forcing yourself to be more masculine than you might really feel.*

Now it's a few years later. No, it's cool, you can call me Emily now. They all know.

I wear women's clothes in public now. I never drink beer, because that's, like, manly. I don't want to do things that people might perceive as masculine. That would be bad, right? I also need to dress really femininely every day. If I just wear pants and a shirt, people might think I'm a guy. And if I don't act femininely enough, some people will be like, why did you even transition? You don't seem like a woman to me. I have to act the part, to justify all this fuss!

I was at a friend's house last week, and they were playing a video game that I used to be good at. But I acted like I didn't know the game that well and lost, because I feel like girls aren't supposed to be good at those games. If I won, they'd probably be, like, "oh, look, a girl is good at a video game"---but really, what they'd be thinking is, "cis women aren't good at video games, but you're good because you're trans". That's not a conversation I want to have, you know?

I also need to be really careful about how I sit, how I do my hair, all that stuff. I need to show everyone that I'm committed. That means maybe leaning less into my masculine-coded hobbies.

I was recently watching videos on YouTube of how girls wave. I'm worried that I might not wave properly. Like, I wave like a dude. I think girls wave by keeping their elbow closer to their torso, while guys move their elbow far away from their torso. I try to keep that in mind, but I keep messing up and waving wrong. Oh god, I hope nobody notices.

*When you aren't closeted anymore but trying to pass, you end up still not being authentic, but now it's the other way around. You feel the need to exaggerate every aspect of yourself to try and fit the gender you identify with as best as you can. And the result is you might force yourself to be more feminine than you really feel.*

At what point can Emily just relax and do what she wants?

## The freedom to not pass

^*Oh shit, do you think that guy could tell I'm trans?*

If someone asks me whether I pass, what I think they mean is whether people who don't know me can tell that I'm trans without being explicitly informed. Can you tell by looking? Or maybe hearing. I don't have a great voice. It's probably not a binary thing---more like, what percentage of people do you pass for? Maybe only 5% of people notice you're trans and the other 95% don't. Maybe it's 50--50.

I don't know the answer for me because it doesn't matter, because I have the incredible privilege of living somewhere that it doesn't matter. Use your imagination for a minute: what if every single person I encounter knew that I was trans without a doubt? **Would that be bad?**

In some places, it would be, because you'd be mistreated for it. Harassed, discriminated against, maybe even physically attacked in the street. But what if you weren't? What if people just thought "hmm, I think that woman is trans", and then nothing really happened? Because they don't hate trans people?

**There are really two kinds of passing.** "I'm a biological male and I want people to assume, at a glance, that I'm a cis woman" is the traditional one, the main one people talk about. But there's also an in-between level that's just as important to me, maybe more: "Sure, I'm a biological male, but I want people to be able to tell, at a glance, that I'm somebody whom they should treat like a woman". That could mean thinking I'm a cis woman, and it could mean being able to tell I'm trans but treating me like a woman anyway, because trans women are women.

If 'passing' means that people who I encounter call me 'she' and generally treat me the way they would treat females, then I guess I pass. But I don't know how many of those people are calling me 'she' because they can tell I'm a trans woman, and that's how one would address a trans woman.

I think the reason 'passing' was such a goal in the past is because only by having people think you're cis would they treat you like a woman. If you live in an accepting, understanding community, then that's not the case. And so, it stops mattering that much.

I think our goal, in a way, is to make it so that passing is no longer so goddamn crucial.

## Going full stealth

Imagine I pass perfectly as a female cis woman born with ovaries. I got, like, a premium vaginoplasty. I hopped in a time machine and went 50 years ahead to a cyberpunk future to get this baby from the best hospital in the world that doesn't even exist yet. Nobody can tell the difference. I'm deep fucking cover.

The question is, at that point, would I tell people I'm trans? Or would I try to cover that up forever, and tell people I'm a cis woman for the rest of my life? I'm not going to condemn you if your answer wouldn't be the same as mine, but I would absolutely tell people. I think there's a significant positive externality to being open about yourself, to being *known* by other people in society.

It's easier to dislike something that's alien, when it's just some weird shit they've heard about on the news. I want people to realize they have a gay cousin, a trans neighbour, a lesbian coworker, or whatever. I want them to have concrete connections in the world to which they can attach these concepts and labels.

It's also easier for queer people to feel lost and alone when they don't know anybody like them. I think by being open about ourselves, we're making a more positive space for the younger people in society like us who are growing up right now.

If you get hired for a new job, and you go in and there's already another trans person working there? Oh my god. It's a wonderful thing because not only are you not alone here, but it's a signal that you're somewhere relatively safe, because hey, look, this person's here. They're doing it.

We reach out to each other in this way.

If I live in a society where there's no anti-trans prejudice at all, then what's the point in hiding it? And if there is anti-trans prejudice, then I wouldn't want to hide it, because I'd want to contribute to ending that prejudice.

I don't like secrecy.
