# Types of masculinity

^2024-11-28

For my purposes here, let's just summarize masculinity as *strong, confident, assertive, dominant*. That seems good enough. From there, you can recognize different subtypes or archetypes. There's probably numerous ways to slice it, but I think one particular spectrum stands out, which for lack of better term I have come to call the suave and the savage.

* The **suave-masculine** is refined, intelligent, sophisticated, gentlemanly. He's well-spoken and cultured---a debonair; but he's still masculine (strong, confident, assertive, dominant).
* The **savage-masculine** is more primal, vigorous, and brash. He's aggressive, he's unfiltered, he acts on his instincts---animalistic, like a caveman. And likewise, he's still masculine.

Not everybody fits perfectly into one or the other, but most men clearly lean one way or the other, and most people who are attracted to men have a preference.

In my experience, the following observation holds true: the more a girl is nerdy and into anime, the more likely she is to prefer suave-masculinity. The more she's into golden retrievers and pepperoni pizza, the less likely she is to prefer suave-masculine (compared with the anime girls). Sound weirdly specific? It is.

I see this spectrum in many places, including people I know in my own life. But often when watching a show or movie, there will be two different guys who are both masculine in different ways, and it's framable using something like this.

For example, not long ago I was thinking about it while watching a show called Fate/Zero, where two characters called Lancer and Rider embody these two different archetypes perfectly.

## Vampires and werewolves

From *Twilight *to *Underworld*, series that have vampires usually feature werewolves and vice versa, and this is a perfect stage for writers to play with the suave and savage. The werewolf and vampire are both powerful, sexy creatures---they're killers, they're assertive and controlling, and they represent an alluring *other*.

But vampires then have a tendency of being more fancy, romantic, and refined. Werewolves, meanwhile, are more primordial and raw. They literally lose control of theirselves in the moonlight---a metaphor for instincts taking over (comparable to a man being uncontrollable with lust).

For many people, taking a glance at the *Twilight *series back when it was popular and seeing the way people argued about Jacob versus Edward seemed confusing, because they're both just young white guys who look similar. But what was playing out was a difference in preference between the more suave vampire and the more savage werewolf.

## Monsters

There's something interesting happening psychologically when women find theirselves attracted to *monsters*, which is the catch-all that I'm going to use to describe anything non-human. It's something that's probably uncomfortable to talk about in broader society.

There's a submissive tendency that can be cast from an individual level ('you dominate me') onto group dynamics ('your group dominates my group'). This probably happened deep in our history, whenever one tribe conquered another. What do you think happened to all the women in a village if the men of some other village killed all their husbands? It's gruesome, but the best survival strategy would be to shrug and accept that you're part of that other tribe now.

Have you ever seen that *Curb Your Enthusiasm *episode where Larry dates a Palestinian woman, and then while having sex she unexpected hits him with "fuck me you Jew bastard, fuck me like Israel fucks my people"? It's an inescapable part of humanity, despite our desire to look away. People don't just think of individuals. We also see each other as members of groups. And sometimes your group getting dominated is sexy, the same way you as an individual getting dominated is. This is what's happening in most race-based sexual play.

Edward and Jacob were played by Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, both attractive guys, but there's more to it than that. Their sex appeal was amplified by the fact they're a different species, and one that's dangerous to humans. It wasn't just about getting dominated by some attractive man. It was about your humanity being dominated by a non-human other.

*Yes, Edward---bite me. Make me one of you (convert me from one group to another).*

## Apollo and Dionysus

There's an old concept in philosophy, literature, art, and possibly other contexts, named after the Greek gods **Apollo **('ah-paul-oh') and **Dionysus **('die-uh-nigh-suss'). Apollo was the god of order, logic, and higher thinking, while Dionysus was the god of festivals, chaos, wine, and dance. This gives to the concepts of *Apollonian *('apple-oh-nee-an'), to mean things that are structured, stable, conventional, disciplined; and *Dionysian *('die-ah-niss-ee-uhn') to mean passionate, wild, spontaneous, and free. I view this as yet another personality axis---which some people have historically argued correlates with masculine and feminine (men being more Apollonian and women being more Dionysian), but I don't think I agree with that. When I look around in this world, I see men and women of both sorts.

#### Examples:

* Sherlock Holmes and his brother Mycroft. Sherlock works alone and is quick on his feet, emotional, impulsive, wild. Mycroft is the more measured *man of the institution*.
* Kirk and Picard from *Star Trek*. Though not in the same series, they're often compared because they're the two most famous starship captains---and while similar, given they're both Starfleet captains, Kirk is more of a daring rogue or risk-taker, while Picard is more of a refined diplomat.
 In this comparison, you can see it's all relative, or about contrast: in comparison with other characters, one could argue that Kirk is Apollonian, because he's part of Starfleet, but he has a more independent personality or attitude. There's a broader spectrum of Apollo to Dionysus, and Kirk is noteworthy for being more Dionysian than the other characters in his environment, despite not being the most Dionysian man in the galaxy.
* In *Star Wars*, I wouldn't describe Luke Skywalker as an Apollonian character overall---he's more balanced. Not everybody is going to lean hard in one direction or the other. But Han Solo is then more Dionysian than Luke is, by comparison. We see that Luke is capable of being daring, working alone, acting on instinct, especially in *Return of the Jedi*, but overall he doesn't seem as wild or chaotic as Solo.

## The tumblr sexyman

The *tumblr sexyman *is a satirical, tongue-in-cheek name that spawned on Tumblr many years ago by Tumblr users making fun of theirselves for their own preferences. Despite sounding silly, it captures something real, which is a pattern of traits that captivated people across many different examples and genres, and which I would describe as a sub-archetype of the suave Dionysian. Typically, a tumblr sexyman is:

* tall, white, and fancy or well-dressed
* often a bit feminine in some ways, especially appearance (bonus points if they have to crossdress at some point for plot reasons)
* cool or edgy, not bubbly or cheerful (they can be optimistic)
* morally grey, or willing to break the rules to get results; not necessarily evil, but definitely not a white-knight paladin do-gooder
* a lone wolf---always independently minded, even if they're fighting for the good guys as part of some broader organization

**Some popular examples of this archetype:**

* some of the Doctors from the Doctor Who series
* Sherlock (from the BBC series), and maybe his brother too
* Kaito Kuroba (Detective Conan), and probably many other anime-ish characters like this one
* Cloud (Final Fantasy VII), even more so in the recent remake
* Alastor (Hazbin Hotel), I think?
