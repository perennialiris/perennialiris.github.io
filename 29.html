# Date formats |2025-01-15

29-1.png|The actual picture I found was more jpeggy, so I made this cleaner version.

I saw this picture the other day. Think about it, how do *you* write dates? I see people post things like this making fun of the 'American' format (when you write it like January 15, 2025)---and I get it, we make fun of Americans because they use the imperial system for measuring distances and volume, which are both sort of dumb. I don't think this is as bad, though!

When it comes to keeping track of dates in a big list or document, I always use the ISO 8601 content, which is for some reason being associated with some Asian countries and Iran here. It's 2025-01-15, or sometimes you write the month with letters to remove any possible ambiguity (because 09-03 could be September 3rd or March 9th), and because it just improves readability: 2025-JAN-15. There's a common 2-letter short-form, which is used for date labels on food. The cream in my fridge just says FE-02.

The two-letter version has some unfortunate possible ambiguities if you don't remember which letter is which. JA has to be January, FE has to be February, but then MA is May, but that looks like it could also be March. March is MR. When I worked in retail, at least a few times every April, when we started getting products shipped in that had MA as their best-by dates, customers would bring one to me thinking it was something that had expired in March, either to alert me or asking if I could get them something fresher. I had to clarify that March is MR. It's something that slips people's minds, because I point out that MA is May and their reaction is always "oh yeah, duh, shit, nevermind, sorry". This could've been avoided if May was MY, since 'Y' is its only unique letter. But the problem is that May is spelled Mai in French, and all our short-forms in Canada are bilingual (every 2-letter short-form works in both languages). I have seen *some* places suggest using MY, but MA remains normal.

June looks like it would create ambiguity because if you make it JU then it looks like it could be July, and if it were JN then maybe that could be January. But in practice, we use JN and I don't think many people confuse them, perhaps because they're far enough apart in the year.

Here's a random date fact, by the way: the months July and August were named two thousand years ago after the Roman emperors Julius and Augustus. They later proposed changing more months to be named after emperors, but only those two were accepted. At some point the Roman government was going to change the name of September to name it after the current emperor Tiberius, but Tiberius himself vetoed it, so it remained September.

What was I talking about?

The reason the ISO date format is good is because it creates a natural sort. If you have thousands of pictures and you want them arranged by date and they were all saved as YYYY-MM-DD, then you can just arrange by name and everything will end up in chronological order, because you sort by year, then things with the same year are sorted by month, then things with the same month are sorted by day. Duh, right? If you save things as 11-28-2024, then all of your November 2022, November 2023, and November 2024 files end up together.

But in real speech, it makes sense that everybody gets used to saying the month first, and then put it first in writing (written speech emulates spoken word more than the other way around), because the month is the most meaningful and relevant information about when something happened in the vast majority of cases that we talk about when something is happening. Like, when did that article come out? In November. When did your wife get that job? Oh, back in February. When are you guys moving, when are you getting that bonus at work, when is your vacation, when are you going back to that college class, blah blah blah. There are so many practical things that just round off at the month because that's specific enough. It gets us to a ~8% chunk of the year (1/12).

The year? That's sometimes specific enough, especially for stuff a long time ago. When did you get that job? Oh, I was hired in 2015. I got this car in 2019. I remember when I got laid off in 2021. My husband and I got married in 2017. And sometimes you talk about days, obviously. I have an appointment on the 23rd, and the US president's term doesn't start til the 20th, and this year Easter is on April 20. These examples aren't eye-opening. But my point is that I'm pretty sure the month being the most important time unit outweighs everything else, except when talking about things that are so short we don't even bother giving them dates at all (e.g. "yesterday", "this evening", or things you refer to by days of the week, like "oh hey on Friday could you...").

And of course, the date on its own is meaningless. Imagine if you ask when something happened and I say it was on the 13th, but I don't remember of what month. What the fuck kind of answer is that? If you had to remove one thing from all the dates in your database, obviously it'd be day. Just round everything to the month. This form was filed in April 2022. That's close enough. I don't care what day. Something I noticed recently is that even people who ask my birthday are often satisfied if I just tell them the month. They really just want a vibe of what time of year it is.

But if you have engineer-brain and want to make the "US" solution (on that image) seem clean, maybe this will help: months go from 1--12. Days go from 1--31. Years go from... well, uh, a there's a lot of possible years. So by saying MM-DD-YYYY, we're going from the narrowest range to the widest. That's a triangle, if you care enough to draw it as one. Bitches love triangles.
